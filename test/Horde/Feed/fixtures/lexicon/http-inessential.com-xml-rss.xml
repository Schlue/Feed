			<title>NetNewsWire progress report: 1.0.7, now with feed removing</title>
			<link>http://inessential.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=3510</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;
I just built NetNewsWire 1.0.7. I have no idea when you&amp;rsquo;ll see it, when it&amp;rsquo;ll get into the App Store &amp;mdash; I&amp;rsquo;m just keeping you up-to-date on progress.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Change notes (since the last time I posted, which was for 1.0.5):
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;1.0.7&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
- You can unsubscribe from feeds or just remove them from the iPhone. (That is, you can remove them from the iPhone location. They&amp;#039;ll continue to appear in other locations.) Click the Edit button to start. Click the circle button, then the Delete button. An action sheet will pop up asking you what you want to do. (Don&amp;#039;t Show in iPhone or Unsubscribe Everywhere. Or Cancel.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
- Fixed a crashing bug that could happen when going to the Next Unread item.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
- Fixed a cause of database-busy errors that could come up when saving a favicon.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;1.0.6&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
- Does more when receiving a memory warning message -- it dumps cached feed and news item objects (except for the current sub).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
- Fixed a small, rare memory leak in the RSS parser. (Did a big leak hunt -- even used scan-build -- and this is all I could find.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
- Fixed a bug introduced in 1.0.5 that could let unread counts get out of sync.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Long-term brain confusion</title>
			<link>http://inessential.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=3509</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;
There are a few things that have confused me all my life. One is the issue of higher numbers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
By that I mean &amp;mdash; which number is higher, 1 or 2? 10 or 7?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I always get it wrong. Here&amp;rsquo;s why:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
1. Here is a list.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
2. Here&amp;rsquo;s a second item.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
3. Here&amp;rsquo;s a third item.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Which number is higher? #1, clearly, is higher &amp;mdash; it&amp;rsquo;s above the subsequent numbers. Just look at it &amp;mdash; it&amp;rsquo;s totally, obviously, unquestionably higher.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But no. Everyone else thinks the other way. Despite the clear evidence of their eyes.
&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Working on deleting feeds</title>
			<link>http://inessential.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=3508</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;
Another NetNewsWire for iPhone progress report...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on NetNewsWire 1.0.6 since yesterday. The main new feature in 1.0.6 will be deleting feeds. When you delete a feed, you have two options of how to delete it:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
1. Don&amp;rsquo;t Show in iPhone &amp;mdash; removes it from your iPhone location, but leaves it intact in other places
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
2. Unsubscribe Everywhere
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I thought about just doing #1 &amp;mdash; but I think it would seem weird not to be able to unsubscribe from a feed completely, so I&amp;rsquo;m doing both.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And then, of course, there are still more bug fixes and some new features to do. Work continues, as always.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
PS Had a root canal yesterday. I like joking that &amp;mdash; given the amount of stress I&amp;rsquo;m in waiting for my updates to appear on the App Store &amp;mdash; the couple hours lying down in the dentist&amp;rsquo;s chair was a nice, relaxing break. ;)
&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Change notes for NetNewsWire for iPhone 1.0.5</title>
			<link>http://inessential.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=3507</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;
Below are the change notes (edited for profanity and such) for NetNewsWire for iPhone 1.0.5. It&amp;rsquo;s not up on the store yet &amp;mdash; 1.0.2 is still In Review. But, one of these days, you&amp;rsquo;ll get an update.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
(I feel very good about this build, especially regarding performance issues. It&amp;rsquo;s much better than 1.0.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m not totally sure why I&amp;rsquo;m posting these, other than that it keeps me from feeling like a black box where you can&amp;rsquo;t see in.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Anyway...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Changes in 1.0.5 (since 1.0.4):&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
- Scrolling is faster in the Feeds list -- now re-using a table cell instead of creating a new one for each row. (Which I had been doing to work around a [REDACTED] in an earlier [REDACTED] of the iPhone [REDACTED]. Glad I don&amp;rsquo;t have to anymore.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
- The + button is now an action-menu button -- because it will have more than just Add to Clippings in it. (Things like email-link, mark-unread, and send-to-Twitterrific will go in there.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
- Email Link now appears in the action menu for news items and for web pages. Both create a new outgoing message in MobileMail with no recipient, but with subject and body filled in. (The link is the body.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
- Fixed a bug where feeds with blank names could appear (because their titles haven&amp;rsquo;t been retrieved yet -- now we&amp;rsquo;re retrieving them first).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
- Fixed a bug where GetSubscriptionsList (a server call) would be called at times unnecessarily.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
- Fixed a bug where a refresh/sync session would happen twice sometimes, unnecessarily.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
- The application icon on the home screen now gets the unread count badge.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
- Total unread count appears at bottom-left of Feeds page (except during refresh/sync).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
- Reversed delete-older-than-two-weeks change from 1.0.4 -- because [REDACTED] [REDACTING] help me if unread counts don&amp;rsquo;t match with the iPhone and other readers. I&amp;rsquo;d be explaining it for the remainder of my natural-born existence.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
- It&amp;rsquo;s now faster to rebuild the Feeds list -- not rebuilding all unread counts every time it loads.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
- When downloading feeds, the status message says the name of the feed, so you can better tell what&amp;rsquo;s happening. (This change, plus putting the unread count at the bottom-left, also have the effect of making this &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; like NetNewsWire.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
- On the news items list view, the Mark All as Read button now does not appear if all items are read.
&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;
As a software developer, the one thing I&amp;rsquo;m good at is listening to users.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ve always worked in public or semi-public: release, listen to feedback, release, listen, repeat forever. I worked this way for years UserLand. All of NetNewsWire was developed this way, beginning with the very earliest betas of NetNewsWire Lite back in 2002.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My entire career has been about software development as social activity (and a little bit as public performance, I admit).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don&amp;rsquo;t know another way to do this &amp;mdash; and, if I did, that other way probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t  suit my temperament. It may not be the best way to do software, but it&amp;rsquo;s the way that works for me.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Which is why I&amp;rsquo;m more than a little bit at sea with the iPhone development experience. Getting beta testers is a technical and &lt;em&gt;legal&lt;/em&gt; challenge. And I&amp;rsquo;m used to having hundreds, not just a few. Discussing development and design issues with other developers is usually a valuable thing, but there&amp;rsquo;s an NDA in the way.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But, then, well, in theory I can do frequent public releases, get lots of feedback, and keep the cycle going. Great theory. Works for me!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course, that is, if I had a way to get my releases to the public... That&amp;rsquo;s where I&amp;rsquo;m bugged. I keep getting feedback on stuff I fixed or changed days ago. And no feedback on the recent changes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://inessential.com/images/atom.gif&quot; width=&quot;29&quot; height=&quot;30&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Anyway, just thought I&amp;rsquo;d wave hi from out here on the waves.
&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>NetNewsWire for iPhone progress</title>
			<link>http://inessential.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=3505</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ve been working like crazy on updates to NetNewsWire for iPhone &amp;mdash; but, unfortunately, updates aren&amp;rsquo;t being pushed to the App Store yet. I don&amp;rsquo;t know why, though I imagine it&amp;rsquo;s just that things are crazy in the early days.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don&amp;rsquo;t know when updates will go out &amp;mdash;&amp;#160;wish I did.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the meantime, here&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing, and here&amp;rsquo;s the plan:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
1. I&amp;rsquo;ve been fixing bugs and performance issues, and implementing some of the more obvious features. (Not done yet, but getting there.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some of the obvious features include things like email-link, choose-clippings-folder, send-to-Twitterrific, mark-as-unread, and remove-feed-from-iPhone-location.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The plan is to finish this up &amp;mdash; make stable and fleshed-out the app as it exists right now.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
2. Then I&amp;rsquo;ll revisit the user interface. A number of people have asked for something like a Combined View, where you see excerpts of news items. A reasonable request, absolutely. But the plan is to shore things up in #1 first, then move on to this, once there&amp;rsquo;s a stable base with a more complete set of features.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Again, I have no idea when any updates will actually appear. But I have indeed been working as quickly as I can &amp;mdash; I&amp;rsquo;ve been pretending to myself that you&amp;rsquo;re actually getting the updates. ;) (Though not completely satisfying, the pretense fools me enough to keep me going.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
PS Here are my change notes since last Friday:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;1.0.4&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
- Worked around feeds without titles -- pulls the title from the first words in the description. (Instapundit&amp;#039;s feed, for instance.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
- Worked around feeds that forget to put an &quot;http://&quot; at the beginning of their home page link.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
- Tightened up metadata display on news item view: categories now appear at the bottom. There&amp;#039;s now a space rather than a line break before the author name.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
- Performance: lots of parsing and processing happens in background threads now, so as not to block the main UI thread.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
- Performance: at parse time, now ignoring any items published more than two weeks ago. This cuts down on the sheer amount of data the app has to manage, and it goes with the idea that the iPhone reader is for reading what&amp;#039;s new. It&amp;#039;s not meant to deal with an archive.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
- Performance: at startup, deletes news items more than 2 weeks old. (See above for reason.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;1.0.3&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
- Small performance gain by not invalidating all unread counts every time a news item changes status. Just invaliding unread counts for affected feeds and folders.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
- When you open a web page inline, it opens in a new view (it slides over, etc.) You can then go back to the news item view.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
- Add to Clippings now works for web pages.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
- The Next Unread button in the web page view moves you back to the news item view before showing the next unread.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
- Settings are now in the main Settings.app, rather than in NetNewsWire. The Account button is gone. (Note: you still enter username and password in the app the first time you run the app, of course. And you enter username and password in the app if there&amp;#039;s an authentication error.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
- Doesn&amp;#039;t always refresh/sync at startup -- only if the last refresh/sync was more than 5 minutes ago.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
- Fixed a caching bug where new news items sometimes wouldn&amp;#039;t get displayed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
- Now displays unread items only (and only feeds with unread items).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
- Added a default screenshot so you get something besides black as the app is loading.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;1.0.2&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
- Decreased the font size of the title in the news item view.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
- If there&amp;#039;s an authentication error contacting our sync server, it&amp;#039;s reported and you can re-enter username and password.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
- Bigger fonts for text fields in setup and options screens.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
- Fixed a crashing bug due to a missing lock.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
- Empties the favicon cache if app receives memory-low warning.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
- After tapping Mark All as Unread, go back to Feeds view.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
- Fixed a couple small memory leaks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
- Mark news item as read the moment the webview starts loading, rather than waiting until it has loaded (which may not happen if you&amp;#039;re off-network).
&lt;/p&gt;</description>

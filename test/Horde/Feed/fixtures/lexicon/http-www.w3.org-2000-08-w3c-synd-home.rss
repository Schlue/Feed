      <title>Workshop report: Role of Mobile Technologies in Fostering Social Development</title>
      <description>2008-06-30: Today W3C publishes a report on the June 2008 Workshop on the Role of Mobile Technologies in Fostering Social Development. Participants discussed how numerous available services on mobile phones could help people in underserved regions. Discussion underlined the need for a concerted effort among all the stakeholders (including practitioners, academics, regulators, and mobile industry) to build a shared view of the future of the mobile platform as a tool to bridge the digital divide. The Workshop was jointly organized by W3C and NIC.br, with the generous support of UNDP and Fundacion CTIC (Gold Sponsors), Opera Software and MobileActive.org (Silver sponsors). This work takes place under the European Union's 7th Research Framework Programme (FP7), part of Digital World Forum project.

      <title>XML Entity definitions for Characters Draft Published</title>
      <description>2008-07-21: The Math Working Group has published the Working Draft of XML Entity definitions for Characters. Many XML entity names are in common use for mathematical symbols, and this specification aims to provide standard mappings to Unicode for each of these names. Learn more about the Math Activity.

      <title>First Drafts of XQuery 1.1 and XQuery 1.1 Use Cases Published</title>
      <description>2008-07-15: The XML Query Working Group has published the First Public Working Drafts of XQuery 1.1 and XQuery 1.1 Use Cases. The former describes a query language called XQuery, which is designed to be broadly applicable across many types of XML data sources. This version of XQuery extends the version of the XQuery 1.0 Recommendation published on 23 January 2007; see the list of changes. The latter document describes usage scenarios that will impact the design of XQuery 1.1. Learn more about the Extensible Markup Language (XML) Activity. (Permalink)</description>

      <title>POWDER Formal Semantics First Working Draft Published</title>
      <description>2008-07-09: The Protocol for Web Description Resources (POWDER) Working Group has published the First Public Working Draft of Protocol for Web Description Resources (POWDER): Formal Semantics. This document underpins the Protocol for Web Description Resources (POWDER). It describes how the relatively simple operational format of a POWDER document can be transformed through two stages, first into a more tightly constrained XML format (POWDER-BASE), and then into an RDF/OWL encoding (POWDER-S) that may be processed by Semantic Web tools. The formal semantics of POWDER are best understood after the reader is acquainted with the Description Resources and Grouping of Resources documents. Learn more about the Semantic Web Activity.

      <title>Relationship Between Mobile Web and Web Content Accessibility Working Draft Published</title>
      <description>2008-07-07: The Mobile Web Best Practices Working Group and the WAI Education and Outreach Working Group have published an updated Working Draft of Relationship between Mobile Web Best Practices (MWBP) and Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). See the announcement email. The groups encourage people to start by reading Web Content Accessibility and Mobile Web: Making a Web Site Accessible Both for People with Disabilities and for Mobile Devices, which shows how design goals for accessibility and mobile access overlap. A third document, Experiences Shared by People with Disabilities and by People Using Mobile Devices, provides examples of barriers that people (without disabilities) face when interacting with Web content via mobile devices, and similar barriers for people with disabilities using desktop computers.

      <title>POWDER Drafts Published: Grouping of Resources; Description Resources</title>
      <description>2008-06-30: The Protocol for Web Description Resources (POWDER) Working Group has published two Protocol for Web Description Resources (POWDER) Working Drafts: Grouping of Resources and Description Resources. The first document describes how to publish descriptions of multiple resources such as all those available from a Web site. These descriptions are always attributed to a named individual, organization or entity that may or may not be the creator of the described resources. The second publication provides a means for individuals or organizations to create machine-readable descriptions. Learn more about the Semantic Web Activity. (Permalink)</description>

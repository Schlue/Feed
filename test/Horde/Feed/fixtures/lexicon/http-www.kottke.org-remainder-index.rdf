<description><![CDATA[<p>The PopTech blog rounds up <a href="http://www.poptech.org/blog/index.php/2008/07/15/wind-turbine-round-up/">some interesting wind turbine designs</a>. I'm particularly intrigued by the placement of turbines on or near highways. One of the knocks against wind farms is that they disrupt the natural landscape...placing wind turbines along highways would somewhat alleviate that problem.

<title>Booking passage on a cargo ship is an easy and unusual</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://thetravelersnotebook.com/how-to/how-to-travel-by-cargo-ship/">Booking passage on a cargo ship is an easy and unusual way to travel</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Most of the major global shipping lines CMA-CGM, Canada Maritime, and Bank Line offer paying passengers to hop on one of their lines. As a paying passenger you are accommodated in guest cabins and have access to most areas of the ship.</p><p>Captains and crew spend a lot of time on the water, and they are usually happy to have a fresh face walking around their workplace, meaning that they may even invite you to eat with them, give you tours of the ship and maybe even have you over for an Officer's happy hour.</p></blockquote>

<p>You'd think it would be cheap but tickets can run you more than airfare...$80-140 per day, meals &amp; lodging included.</p>]]><![CDATA[ (<a href="http://www.kottke.org/remainder/08/07/16098.html">link</a>)]]></description>

<title>The pogo stick in named after a Burmese farm girl? As</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.pogostickusa.com/history.htm">The pogo stick in named after a Burmese farm girl</a>?</p>

<blockquote>As legend has it, an American traveler named George Hansburg was making his way through Burma when he made the acquaintance of a poor farmer. The farmer's daughter was named Pogo, and Pogo -- devout little girl that she was -- wanted to go to temple every day to pray, but couldn't because she had no shoes to wear for the long walk through the mud and rocks. So the poor farmer built a jumping stick for her, and Pogo's daily temple bounce-trips through the mud and over the rocks ensued. When the impressed traveler returned home, he made a jumping stick of his own, attaching a spring to the wooden stick contraption that the farmer had introduced him to.</blockquote>]]><![CDATA[ (<a href="http://www.kottke.org/remainder/08/07/16090.html">link</a>)]]></description>

<title>The Disadvantages of an Elite Education, nutshelled: you have no idea</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.theamericanscholar.org/su08/elite-deresiewicz.html">The Disadvantages of an Elite Education</a>, nutshelled: you have no idea how most of the rest of the world works.</p>

<blockquote>The first disadvantage of an elite education, as I learned in my kitchen that day, is that it makes you incapable of talking to people who aren't like you. Elite schools pride themselves on their diversity, but that diversity is almost entirely a matter of ethnicity and race. With respect to class, these schools are largely-indeed increasingly-homogeneous. Visit any elite campus in our great nation and you can thrill to the heartwarming spectacle of the children of white businesspeople and professionals studying and playing alongside the children of black, Asian, and Latino businesspeople and professionals. At the same time, because these schools tend to cultivate liberal attitudes, they leave their students in the paradoxical position of wanting to advocate on behalf of the working class while being unable to hold a simple conversation with anyone in it.</blockquote>

<title>NY Times columnist David Carr has written a book about his</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>NY Times columnist David Carr has written <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1416541527/ref=nosim/0sil8">a book about his days as a junkie</a> who cleaned himself up only when twin daughters came into his life. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/20/magazine/20Carr-t.html?pagewanted=all">The Times has a lengthy excerpt</a>; it's possibly the best thing I've read all week.</p>

<blockquote>If I said I was a fat thug who beat up women and sold bad coke, would you like my story? What if instead I wrote that I was a recovered addict who obtained sole custody of my twin girls, got us off welfare and raised them by myself, even though I had a little touch of cancer? Now we're talking. Both are equally true, but as a member of a self-interpreting species, one that fights to keep disharmony at a remove, I'm inclined to mention my tenderhearted attentions as a single parent before I get around to the fact that I hit their mother when we were together. We tell ourselves that we lie to protect others, but the self usually comes out looking damn good in the process.</blockquote>

<p>Carr's book is not the conventional memoir. Instead of relying on his spotty memory from his time as a junkie, he went out and interviewed his family, friends, enemies, and others who knew him at the time to get a more complete picture.</p>

<p>A former colleague <a href="http://www.rakemag.com/reporting/features/news-junkie">interviewed Carr two years ago in Rake Magazine</a>.

<title>‚óè Old iPhone price check on eBay</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Before the iPhone 3G came out last month, <a href="http://www.kottke.org/08/06/valuable-old-iphones">I wrote about how valuable the old iPhone still was</a>.</p>

<blockquote>A quick search reveals that used &amp; unlocked 8Gb iPhones are going for ~$400 and 16Gb for upwards of $500, with never-opened phones going for even more.</blockquote>

<p>I just checked eBay again and those prices are down only slightly. Never-opened unlocked iPhones are still fetching $400-500 and somewhat less for previously used phones. If you've purchased an iPhone 3G in the past few days, you still have an excellent shot at getting most of your money back from your first phone (provided you can get it unlocked, which <a href="http://www.intomobile.com/2008/03/02/iphone-v114-jailbreak-and-sim-unlock-guide-mac-only-for-now.html">isn't difficult</a>).</p>

<p>I also checked the prices for unlocked iPhone 3Gs...prices are upwards of $1400 for the 16GB model. The unlocked claim is somewhat dubious. AFAIK, there hasn't been a crack released yet although it's been reported that the 3Gs are being sold unlocked in Italy and Hong Kong.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5025249/iphone-3g-unlocked-with-sim-card-adapter">The 3G has been cracked</a>.</p>]]></description>

<blockquote><p>You may see now the author's dilemma. Publishers and bookstores are in it for the money. But you, the author, can't be in it for the money - it doesn't pay enough. You should write a book because you believe in it. And that's the trouble: what you love isn't necessarily what publishers believe will sell. If you can find a topic that you love and that will sell in the market, well then, go forth and type. You're one of the lucky ones.</p></blockquote>

<title>Spike Jonze&apos;s Where the Wild Things Are might be in trouble.</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Spike Jonze's Where the Wild Things Are might be in trouble. It was originally due out in October, got pushed back to fall 2009, and <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/the_big_picture/2008/07/is-spike-jonze.html">has now been taken off of the Warner Bros. release schedule</a>. But not all is lost...here's what Warner had to say about it:</p>

<blockquote><p>We've given him more money and, even more importantly, more time for him to work on the film," Horn said. "We'd like to find a common ground that represents Spike's vision but still offers a film that really delivers for a broad-based audience. We obviously still have a challenge on our hands. But I wouldn't call it a problem, simply a challenge. No one wants to turn this into a bland, sanitized studio movie. This is a very special piece of material and we're just trying to get it right.</p></blockquote>]]><![CDATA[ (<a href="http://www.kottke.org/remainder/08/07/16081.html">link</a>)]]></description>

<title>Since repeatedly spelling out proper names in sign language is time</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Since repeatedly spelling out proper names in sign language is time consuming, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/ouch/features/sign_names.shtml">signers give people "sign names" that are faster to do</a>.</p>

<blockquote>When a sign name is given to you, it's special. A bit like losing your deaf virginity. It's thought up after an intense period of observation, when people have worked out firstly whether they like you enough to give you one (a sign name, that is), and they've taken all your habits and mannerisms into account to find a name that best sums you up.</blockquote>

<title>The NYC subway system&apos;s unlimited-ride MetroCard turned ten years old this</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/16/nyregion/16metrocard.html">The NYC subway system's unlimited-ride MetroCard turned ten years old this month</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>"I think it's absolutely changed travel habits in the New York region, and it's been a boon for the economy as well," said Andrew Albert, who represents transit riders on the board of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. "Where once you might have used it more sparingly because you had a finite number of trips, you're more likely to take a trip during your lunch break, go shopping perhaps or go to dinner somewhere," he said.</p></blockquote>

<p>On average, unlimited-ride MetroCard users take 56 trips per month (~$1.45 per trip), <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2008/07/16/nyregion/16metrocardbell.ready.html">although some take many more or less</a>. (via <a href="http://buzzfeed.com">buzzfeed</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="http://frumin.net/ation/2008/07/its_the_distribution_stupid.html">Mike Frumin notes</a> that the Times excluded from their graph an important piece of information: the break-even point of the 30-day MetroCard. I used to get a monthly card but now pay by the ride because I don't take the subway everyday anymore and would therefore find myself in Frumin's "losing $$$$$" zone.</p>]]><![CDATA[ (<a href="http://www.kottke.org/remainder/08/07/16068.html">link</a>)]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p>That string of typographic symbols that substitute for swearing in cartoons? <a href="http://www.typography.com/ask/showBlog.php?blogID=122">It's called a grawlix</a>.</p>

<blockquote>The term is grawlix, and it looks to have been coined by Beetle Bailey cartoonist Mort Walker around 1964. Though it's yet to gain admission to the Oxford English Dictionary, OED Editor-at-Large Jesse Sheidlower describes it as "undeniably useful, certainly a word, and one that I'd love to see used more."</blockquote>

<title>‚óè The most beautiful suicide</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>On May 1, 1947, Evelyn McHale leapt to her death from the observation deck of the Empire State Building. Photographer Robert Wiles took a photo of McHale a few minutes after her death.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.kottke.org/plus/misc/images/evelyn-mchale.jpg" width="500" height="667" alt="Evelyn Mchale by Robert Wiles" /></p>

<p>The photo ran a couple of weeks later in Life magazine accompanied by the following caption:</p>

<blockquote><p>On May Day, just after leaving her fianc&eacute;, 23-year-old Evelyn McHale wrote a note. 'He is much better off without me ... I wouldn't make a good wife for anybody,' ... Then she crossed it out. She went to the observation platform of the Empire State Building. Through the mist she gazed at the street, 86 floors below. Then she jumped. In her desperate determination she leaped clear of the setbacks and hit a United Nations limousine parked at the curb. Across the street photography student Robert Wiles heard an explosive crash. Just four minutes after Evelyn McHale's death Wiles got this picture of death's violence and its composure.</p></blockquote>

<p>From McHale's NY Times obituary, <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60D16FA3F58147B93C0A9178ED85F438485F9">Empire State Ends Life of Girl, 20</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>At 10:40 A. M., Patrolman John Morrissey of Traffic C, directing traffic at Thirty-fourth Street and Fifth Avenue, noticed a swirling white scarf floating down from the upper floors of the Empire State. A moment later he heard a crash that sounded like an explosion. He saw a crowd converge in Thirty-third Street.</p><p>Two hundred feet west of Fifth Avenue, Miss McHale's body landed atop the car. The impact stove in the metal roof and shattered the car's windows. The driver was in a near-by drug store, thereby escaping death or serious injury.</p><p>On the observation deck, Detective Frank Murray of the West Thirtieth Street station, found Miss McHale's gray cloth coat, her pocketbook with several dollars and the note, and a make-up kit filled with family pictures.</p></blockquote>

<p>The serenity of McHale's body amidst the crumpled wreckage it caused is astounding. Years later, Andy Warhol appropriated Wiles' photography for a print called Suicide (Fallen Body), but I can't find a copy of it anywhere online. <a href="http://www.kottke.org/about/contact.html">Anyone?</a></p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> A not-so-great representation of Warhol's version of this photograph <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=KemglT-1jSIC&pg=PA67&lpg=PA67&dq=%22Suicide+(Fallen+Body)%22&source=web&ots=X6nfAIHOv9&sig=t_9JCaAbwRpbQLnF7JS9K_pxTkE&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=4&ct=result#PPA68,M1">is available at Google Books</a>.

<title>A cross-country Amtrak travelogue. The trip is not without its charms</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.goodmagazine.com/section/Features/train_in_vain">A cross-country Amtrak travelogue</a>. The trip is not without its charms but overall sounds like torture.</p>

<blockquote><p>A raspy-voiced woman in her 40s, one of the engineers, calls down from the cab and invites a few of us to come take a look. Without hesitation we clamber up. She tells us that they're off duty, as her partner, a mustachioed, red-faced man with faded tattoos, nods. When engineers hit their driving quota, apparently, they're done. It's an unbendable rule. "They knew, though," the woman says, speaking of Amtrak. "They should have had someone here." So this could've been prevented? "Oh yeah," the man says, "but leave it to them and they'll fuck it up." And so we wait, in the middle of nowhere, for new engineers. After a couple of hours a truck pulls up with the new drivers.</p></blockquote>]]><![CDATA[ (<a href="http://www.kottke.org/remainder/08/07/16065.html">link</a>)]]></description>

      <description>Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) Community of Nepal (FOSS-Nepal)&#xD;
observed the fifth international Software Freedom Day today. The day was&#xD;
celebrated by over 500 different volunteer groups in 120 countries. The&#xD;
theme for this year's celebration of FOSS-Nepal was "Create, Share,&#xD;
Collaborate." Honourable Minister of Science and Technology, Ganesh Shah&#xD;
started the proceedings at Yala Maya Kendra in Patan, Kathmandu by&#xD;
unveiling a compilation of Free/Open Source Softwares in a CD named&#xD;
"Nirvikalpa." Honourable Minister also announced the launch of a&#xD;
web-portal named "Prasfutan." "Prasfutan" which means "blossoming" in&#xD;
English aims to provide a collaborative environment to a vast number of&#xD;
local talents in Nepal whose creativity has a reach only up to a limited&#xD;
audience comprising of their acquaintances. This is in sync with the&#xD;
theme of "Create, Share, Collaborate."</description>

      <title>Pyjamas - Python Applications for Desktop and Web</title>
      <link>http://www.advogato.org/article/981.html</link>

      <description>Leading free software application widget sets include GTK2, QT4 and&#xD;
wxWidgets.  Web application development is still considered to be a bit&#xD;
of a black art, with knowledge of CSS, javascript and AJAX trickery&#xD;
making many side-step HTML completely and go for Adobe Flash or&#xD;
Silverlight to get that "rich media" experience that typical Web apps&#xD;
entirely lack.  And, worse, writing apps that run - unmodifed - on both&#xD;
the desktop and the web is impossible if you want to stick to Free&#xD;
Software development principles and ethics.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; AJAX "toolkits" as they are known, such as YUI, Google Web Toolkit and Pyjamas are the&#xD;
"middle-ground" to making Web application development look and feel that&#xD;
much more like you're developing a real desktop application.  In the&#xD;
case of GWT and Pyjamas, you're even programming in Java or Python,&#xD;
respectively, and the tool is actually a javascript compiler!  The next&#xD;
logical step is to ask the question, "If these toolkits look,&#xD;
feel and smell like Desktop applications development APIs, why are they&#xD;
not *actually* Desktop applications development APIs?".  Pyjamas-Desktop&#xD;
is the answer to that question, effectively making Pyjamas a de-facto&#xD;
standard for cross-browser, cross-platform, cross-desktop,&#xD;
cross-environment and, ultimately, a cross-widget-set Free Software&#xD;
applications development API.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Finally, there's a way for free software&#xD;
developers to write applications that run - unmodified - as both a web&#xD;
app and a desktop app.&#xD;

      <description>There's an ongoing debate about whether&#xD;
a free/open source project needs to be "organic" to be worthwhile,&#xD;
where "organic" is (arguably) defined as a project which the first&#xD;
release included source, and is generally characterized as by a&#xD;
distributed development team with no single company truly in control,&#xD;
and "inorganic" is generally code that started off life as a proprietary&#xD;
effort.  I'd like to argue that making "inorganic" open source work is a&#xD;
big challenge worth tackling.&#xD;

      <title>The Myth that Content Management is easy</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;The Myth&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Content Management is easy. You download one of the numerous systems&#xD;
available, plug-in your data. Something magical happens (???) and out&#xD;
comes a professional looking and operating website. This obviously&#xD;
manages all of your content from all different sources with ease. All&#xD;
you have to do is make a template and you&amp;rsquo;re done! If this sounds like&#xD;
something you&amp;rsquo;ve heard and are suspiciously weary of. You should be,&#xD;
because it&amp;rsquo;s all snake oil! If it was that easy I would probably quit my&#xD;
job and go study law. Since it is not, let us continue first by giving a&#xD;
brief background on what content management is.</description>

      <description>Skype fought the GPL and the GPL won. The OLPC XO project abandons free&#xD;
software just as RMS switches to an XO; RMS not happy. New monthly&#xD;
newsletters from the FSF and FSFE. GNOME and KDE want to have a joint&#xD;
development conference in 2009. GNOME and GCC conferences coming up&#xD;
later this year. Plus all the usual news: more GPL v3 conversions, HURD&#xD;
news, GNOME news, GCC news, and more.</description>

      <title>Rsync on Steroids</title>

      <description>Rsync is an incredibly&#xD;
powerful tool that synchronises anything from a single file to an entire&#xD;
hierarchical filesystem, over a network.  Unlike many other&#xD;
synchronisation methods, rsync will use the outdated copy of a file to&#xD;
save on network traffic (resulting in anything up to 99% optimisation).&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Rsync the &lt;i&gt;implementation&lt;/i&gt;&#xD;
however is restricted to only Posix systems (such as Linux, Cygwin and&#xD;
*BSD), and, worse, its implementation can only perform operations on&#xD;
Posix-based filesystems.  This seems somewhat puzzling, and, as part&#xD;
 of the continued Tech Fusion series, this&#xD;
article will outline some of the amazingly powerful things that could be&#xD;
done with rsync... &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt; it had a VFS layer.&#xD;

      <description>informal though this is, it's important enough to say as an article. &#xD;
i've been keeping an eye on the series currently being written and some&#xD;
of my comments - most notably to Pizza - indicate that i'm "jumping up&#xD;

      <title>Distributed Debian Distribution Development</title>

      <description>As part of the Tech Fusion Outline Series,&#xD;
this article describes some additions to the Debian Distribution model&#xD;
which, if implemented, would have the benefits of making Debian,&#xD;
the Debian Development and deployment entirely independent of&#xD;
Server-based Infrastructure.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The brief outline will be expanded in this dedicated article, pointing&#xD;
out how tieing together components and technology that already exists&#xD;
would be useful not only for Debian but also for other purposes, such&#xD;
as video and audio media distribution.  &lt;tt&gt;(A method of payment for&#xD;
work on Debian or other media is not within the scope of this article&#xD;
but is easily conceivable).&lt;/tt&gt;  This article therefore explains how&#xD;
and why Debian Distribution Development could go "Distributed".</description>

      <title>Free Choice: the "Social Business" model and Free Software</title>
      <link>http://www.advogato.org/article/971.html</link>
      <guid>http://www.advogato.org/article/971.html</guid>
      <pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2008 23:56:18 GMT</pubDate>
      <description>Free Software developers fall into two main categories: those that&#xD;
stand by the principles behind free software - patent-free,&#xD;
license-free and unrestricted distribution (for example, Richard&#xD;
Stallman's admirable stance); and those that are simply happy to&#xD;
compromise to some extent, for example to download libdvdcss to watch&#xD;
DVDs, or to install proprietary software such as Skype, on the basis&#xD;
that there is simply no (or no better) alternative (for example, Ubuntu&#xD;
which supports all kinds of proprietary firmware and binary drivers, and&#xD;
gets itself into enormous difficulties as a result).&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt; These "level of integrity" choices are decisions that we, as Free&#xD;
Software developers, are free to make.  Yet the average person is&#xD;
simply unaware of these issues of "integrity", or they are but do not&#xD;
value them highly, choosing "interoperability with their friends and&#xD;
businesses" as "more important".  Or worse, they agree that integrity is&#xD;
important yet are forced into making decisions to use - and stick with -&#xD;
proprietary software.  In such instances, the level of experience of&#xD;
(and thus the offerings available from) Free Software developers in a&#xD;
particular area of specialist expertise that the users absolutely must&#xD;
have before being able to consider migration, is close to or literally&#xD;
zero.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt; As Free Software developers, is it therefore ethical for us to ignore&#xD;
these people whose lives are blighted by lack of choice, or is it more&#xD;
ethical for us to remain in our integrity, by providing&#xD;
non-interoperable Free Software alternatives (with no means of&#xD;
conversion between the free and proprietary software)?&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt; To put that another way: should Free Software developers serve&#xD;
themselves and their own needs, or should they look to serve others?&#xD;
This article highlights these quite important questions that every Free&#xD;
Software developer should be asking themselves, and advocates a way to&#xD;
proliferate, protect, enjoy and benefit from Free Software&#xD;
principles: that of the "Social Business".&#xD;

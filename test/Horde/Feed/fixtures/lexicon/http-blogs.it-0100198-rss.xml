<p>Got my new Wordpress 2.6 up and running and for the first time - there&#8217;s a media library - where I can actually see my images from the past.  Here&#8217;s one of the old relics.  This was from a dinner we had at Max&#8217;s at the airport.  Note that Michael Arrington was nowhere as famous as he is today andneither was Jeff Clavier, Richard MacManus - and this groupie (Jennifer) - who was there (not for me) but for Mr. Arrington.  I also love the % of reduction controls!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://gillmorgang.techcrunch.com/2008/07/16/gillmor-gang-071608-2/">I just did a 1:30 hour long</a> <a href="http://gillmorgang.techcrunch.com/">show with Steve Gillmor</a> on <a href="http://gillmorgang.techcrunch.com/2008/07/16/gillmor-gang-071608-2/">my ideas and writings surrounding the open mesh.</a></p>
<p>Steve argued with me, and &#8216;<em>held my feet to the fire</em>&#8216; on many of my ideas and assumptions regarding the open mesh.  I find this sort of interaction incredibly helpful as it&#8217;s important to get push back from your peers.  Most importantly Steve listened to what I had to say and the assumptions and foundations on which I operate to come up with these principles, areas of focus and perception of just what the <strong>open mesh is</strong>.</p>
<p>From this conversation it should be clear just hw many of my ideas are &#8216;<em>science fiction</em>&#8216; (as Steve likes to put it), what suggestions are pragmatic designs and most importantly what&#8217;s here today already.  By viewing the world through the &#8216;open mesh&#8217; sunglasses perspective one starts to see a world where we all can live together, and use BOTH Microsoft&#8217;s infrastructure, Google&#8217;s grid, Twitter&#8217;s backbone, XMPP&#8217;s transport layer, RSS, OpenSocial Ver5 APIs, OpenID, oAuth, Yahoo&#8217;s ID layer and Facebook&#8217;s ecosystem.</p>
<p>Steve pointed me to <a href="http://www.techcrunchit.com/2008/07/15/back-on-track/">his latest on TechCrunchIT where he &#8220;Back on  Track&#8221; where he eloquently spells out why Twitter is our infrastructure of the future.</a>  But in true Steve style and fashion he also points out that Microsoft Live Mesh launched yesterday and that IT might well be the uber architecture infrastructure of our future.</p>
<p>At which point I replied <strong><em>&#8220;Great! - we love them all - I just wanna make sure to make a few shekels for my children and wife&#8221;</em></strong> (I&#8217;m paraphrasing here.) <img src='http://blog.broadbandmechanics.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> Baking monetization in - for all us small fry - is also part of the rap!</p>

<p>Being able to enable our customers to offer their customers the ability to automatically access their Facebook social graph and invite their friends into the social network we&#8217;re building for them.</p>
<p>This is a demand and expectation from ALL our customers. We&#8217;re willing to jump through the hoops, respect the TOS and do whatever it takes - but we GOTTA have the ability to &#8217;store&#8217; the user&#8217;s profile data in their account on OUR system.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what Facebook says they&#8217;re gonna cover on July 23rd at their F8 devconf:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Integrating Facebook Connect into your Website</strong><br />
Since 2006, Facebook Platform APIs have supported integration into your website to make your site social. In this session, we will walk through the new features that will be available with Facebook Connect. Learn how Facebook Connect can help you socialize and streamline your website using trusted authentication, real identity, friends access, and dynamic privacy.</p></blockquote>
<p>I just hope we can do what we gotta do.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> We had a great weekend, doing nothing but hanging at home and swimming all day long. Ah California.</p>
<p><a href="http://mashable.com/2008/07/13/plurk-statistics/">This excellent analysis of Plurk&#8217;s rise and fall proves a point I tried to make about Ning. </a> As 100,000&#8217;s of worthless networks get created on Ning, there is valuable data in there about what it takes to build a successful, niche social network.  How many Ning networks really gain traction?  1 in 1,000? 1 in 10,000?  Plurk has shown that those who REALLY want to talk (<em>ala </em>Plurk) <strong>can </strong>- and the Twitter downtime helped bring  allot of tire kickers to Plurk, and some have actually hung around.  So now imagine that petrie dish on Ning.  What does it take to stick around?  Is it about featurss, people, timing, - what? The rise of vertical niche networks is our future and Ning is a great viewfinder into that future - if only they would release their real stats - not just brag about the total # of networks - which is totally worthless.  IMHO</p>
<p>Great News!  <a href="http://Identi.ca"><strong>Evan Prodromou </strong>is working hard at getting messages to work ACROSS Identi.ca instantiations</a>!   Now we&#8217;re meshing!</p>

<p><a href="http://eventful.com/my">Just got invited into Eventful - via some &#8217;social media&#8217; kind of functionality. </a>They have a feature  called &#8216;Demand&#8217; (which has fans request bands in certain areas.)  Events are a  key kind of micro-content and Eventful is leading the way.   The Groups are fairly worthless and you can&#8217;t import from Facebook or MySpace - this is typically what happens when &#8220;just about every&#8221; adds social media features.  How can they POSSIBLY keep up with the Jones?  And it&#8217;s only going to get worse.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/shifted/2679953230/" title="gaming sign at the Civic Center Library in Scottsdale,AZ by The Shifted Librarian, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3212/2679953230_bb0d66dd6d_o.jpg" width="282" height="320" alt="gaming sign at the Civic Center Library in Scottsdale, AZ" hspace="3" vspace="3" align="left" /></a> &#8220;We recently completed a 6-month trial of Family Gaming at the Civic Center Library, City of Scottsdale, Arizona.  It began as an Adult Gaming program, but we didn&#8217;t seem to be able to draw in enough adults to make it worthwhile to be strictly an adult program.</p>
<p>We did find out, however, from the first program that we drew patrons of all ages and had an attendance figure (based on an electronic door counter) of 200-300.  The nice thing was the diversity, not just in terms of race, but ages as well of the attendees.  If ever asked about the Wii, you can pass on that I had one woman who was in a wheelchair after 7 back surgeries playing Wii with her grandson, and I had one man who, although legally blind, was able to pitch an inning of baseball.  In the end, we had over 1,100 attendees for the program. </p>
<p>Just some basic facts: Scottsdale Public Library has a pretty successful teem gaming program (begun by me 3 years ago), and is holding gaming for kids 6-11 this summer at 2 libraries. I had 5 gaming systems: PS3 playing Rock Band, XBox 360 playing Viva Piñata, Wii playing Wii Sports, and 2 PS2&#8217;s playing Guitar Hero and DDR (the first month), and NickToons-the last five months.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Thank you to Rick for letting me know about this. I can&#8217;t wait to hear how the summer program goes.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So it turns out there are a couple of potentially controversial things about the current issue of <em><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/">The New Yorker</a></em>, one of them being an article called &#8220;<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/07/21/080721fa_fact_lepore?currentPage=all">The Lion and the Mouse</a>&#8221; by Jill Lepore. I&#8217;ve always agreed with the ethic and attitude of &#8220;Library 2.0,&#8221; even though I didn&#8217;t like the implication that libraries had never before in our history evolved. For me, it symbolizes the need to change again, in what may seem to some like radical ways (online conversations, user-generated content, zoned physical spaces, collaborative relationships with users, etc.), but this article shows just one example of when this happened in the past. Libraries responded then, as many are responding now.</p>
<p>As a proponent of gaming in libraries, one of the criticisms I hear about the movement is that libraries are for books and the edification of the mind. That we shouldn&#8217;t corrupt young minds with games, and that we shouldn&#8217;t use games as a ploy to get kids in the door. But libraries are vibrant places where quite a wide range of other things happen besides just books, and I think it&#8217;s sad when patrons or librarians portray us as just warehouses. Any building can be a book warehouse - that&#8217;s not what makes us &#8220;libraries&#8221; and community centers (regardless of type of library), and librarians certainly aren&#8217;t &#8220;book tellers,&#8221; just sitting behind a desk waiting to hand over a book in return for seeing a library card.</p>
<p>I believe quite strongly that libraries are about content, people, and communities. The people create community there, often around the content, but not always, especially in public libraries where we also serve a recreational role. All of this is why I believe gaming in libraries is a perfect fit, and I cringe when I hear someone conjure up &#8220;the good old days&#8221; when all kids did was sit in the library and read. When I hear this, I wonder whose childhood they&#8217;re remembering, because while I certainly loved the library and would often read there, a lot of my friends never went there, maybe even most of them. The truth is that a lot of the kids I grew up with weren&#8217;t spending their days reading the classics unless they were forced to by teachers, let alone enlightening their minds by just sitting quietly in the middle of the library.</p>
<p>And if we go back far enough in &#8220;the good old days,&#8221; it turns out they couldn&#8217;t have done those things even if they&#8217;d wanted to, because children simply weren&#8217;t allowed in the library, a point brought home in <em>The New Yorker</em> piece. While the author spends the majority of the article discussing rivalries between the early players in the world of book reviews of children&#8217;s literature, the background history is relevant to our own discussions today.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;At the time [1895], you had to be fourteen, and a boy, to get into the Astor Library, which opened in 1854, the same year as the Boston Public Library, the country’s first publicly funded city library, where you had to be sixteen. Even if you got inside, the librarians would shush you, carping about how the &#8216;young fry&#8217; read nothing but &#8216;the trashy&#8217;: Scott, Cooper, and Dickens (one century’s garbage being, as ever, another century’s Great Books). Samuel Tilden, who left $2.4 million to establish a free library in New York, nearly changed his mind when he found out that ninety percent of the books checked out of the Boston Public Library were fiction. Meanwhile, libraries were popping up in American cities and towns like crocuses at first melt. Between 1881 and 1917, Andrew Carnegie underwrote the construction of more than sixteen hundred public libraries in the United States, buildings from which children were routinely turned away, because they needed to be protected from morally corrupting books, especially novels. In 1894, at the annual meeting of the American Library Association, the Milwaukee Public Library’s Lutie Stearns read a &#8216;Report on the Reading of the Young.&#8217; What if libraries were to set aside special books for children, Stearns wondered, shelved in separate rooms for children, staffed by librarians who actually liked children?</p>
<p>Much of what [Anne Carroll] Moore did in that room had never been done before, or half as well. She brought in storytellers and, in her first year, organized two hundred story hours (and ten times as many two years later). She compiled a list of twenty-five hundred standard titles in children’s literature. She won the right to grant borrowing privileges to children; by 1913, children’s books accounted for a third of all the volumes borrowed from New York’s branch libraries. Against the prevailing sentiment of the day, she believed that her job was to give &#8216;to the child of foreign parentage a feeling of pride in the beautiful things of the country his parents have left&#8230;.&#8217; In each of the library’s branches, Moore abolished age restrictions. Down came the &#8216;Silence&#8217; signs, up went framed prints of the work of children’s-book illustrators. “Do not expect or demand perfect quiet,” she instructed her staff. &#8216;The education of children begins at the open shelves.&#8217; In place of locked cabinets, she provided every library with a big black ledger; if you could sign your name, you could borrow a book.&#8221; (<em>Thanks, Richard</em>!)</p></blockquote>
<p>So when we talk about &#8220;the good old days,&#8221; let&#8217;s be sure to specify which period we&#8217;re referring to, because just over a hundred years ago, fiction was the great corrupter of young minds. A few decades later, it was E. B. White&#8217;s &#8220;Stuart Little.&#8221;</p>
<p>But things change, and now it&#8217;s games in the libraries that are bad influences or candy or inappropriate instead of books. What a difference a century makes! How much more powerful is it to look back on our history and see how library services to all patrons have changed during the last hundred years? It&#8217;s something to be proud of, even as we experience another transitional period and change again to serve new [and old] users in new ways.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a long-time Palm OS Treo user now on a Centro, I&#8217;ve been able to add any third-party application to my cell phone for <em>years</em>. In fact, before my Centro, one of my biggest problems was fitting all of the apps I&#8217;d downloaded on the phone and SD card. So it&#8217;s with a high level of amusement that I&#8217;ve watched iPhone users extol their new ability to add Apple-sanctioned apps to their phones.</p>
<p>Yes, these folks are having a blast extending the usefulness of their devices because they can finally install non-Apple-produced software. While I am indeed chuckling to myself a little, overall this is a good thing, even if it does work only in a closed system. Why? Because it&#8217;s raising the bar for a larger percentage of the population. Expectations for interacting with information are again changing for millions of people, and that&#8217;s going to change how they expect to interact with their libraries, too. <a href="http://blogs.lib.berkeley.edu/shimenawa.php/2008/07/14/the_show_room_library">It&#8217;s great to see folks like Peter Brantley thinking about what this means</a>.</p>
<p>But back to all of the new iPhone app users - welcome to the world of being able to truly customize and personalize your smartphone. You no longer have a one-size fits all information device; instead, you now carry with you everywhere a miniature computer designed just for you. Your life will never be the same again, kind of the way things changed when you received your first email message or surfed the web for the first time.</p>
<p>In the spirit of welcoming you into the fold, I offer you some time-tested advice about your new best friend that you just can&#8217;t seem to put down.</p>
<ol>
<li> You&#8217;re in that &#8220;wow, look at this app&#8221; and &#8220;wow, look at that app&#8221; phase, which is totally cool. I&#8217;ve been there myself, and the wow factor is difficult to resist. You <em>should</em> be having fun now that you can finally add functionality to your phone. I haven&#8217;t looked at the iTunes App store myself, and I don&#8217;t have an iPhone, so I&#8217;m taking a guess these are available, but take advantage of the trials to find out if you&#8217;ll really use an app before you purchase it. Experimenting is a good thing.</li>
<li> Inevitably, you&#8217;ll install some apps now just because you can, and a few months from now you&#8217;ll realize you&#8217;re never actually using some of them. It&#8217;s okay to delete them. Really. They&#8217;re just taking up room and cluttering up your interface. If you really miss it, you can always go back and add it again.</li>
<li> Games are a good thing, and I&#8217;m thrilled that you&#8217;ll finally be joining the portable gaming world. Having one or two games is a great thing, especially if you have kids. I can&#8217;t tell you how many times I&#8217;ve been standing in a line, blood pressure rising because I hate waiting, and then I started playing a game, which helped pass the time much more quickly. My stepkids loved using my phone to play games while waiting in long lines, thereby maintaining everyone&#8217;s sanity. I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing what innovative games appear for this new platform, so keep us posted on the best ones as they start appearing.</li>
<li> As many of you are already finding out, that device in your pocket is now like having a mini-laptop attached to your hip. But the same way laptop batteries drain with constant use, so will your iPhone. So all those apps that are constantly checking the web - see suggestion #2 above. If you&#8217;re not using it and it&#8217;s draining your battery, delete it. Ask yourself if you really need to check email every minute or if it&#8217;s better (and healthier) to check it every hour or even less. Trust me - all of that email will still be there.</li>
<li> Or, <a href="http://www.edelmandigital.com/blog/2008/07/in_praise_of_airplane_mode_1.html">as Steve Rubel has suggested, turn off the wireless</a>. You don&#8217;t need to be hyper-connected 24/7, and it&#8217;s okay to put down the iPhone and walk away from it for a while. It - and all of your apps - will still be there when you get back. As Peter Parker&#8217;s Uncle Ben said, &#8220;With great power comes great responsibility.&#8221; You&#8217;re carrying around a lot of power with you now, but you need to control it, rather than letting it control you. Don&#8217;t get so caught up in the fun and new-found productivity that you lose the ability to disconnect, or worse yet, focus on the people you&#8217;re with. Basically, remember the axiom that just because you can, doesn&#8217;t mean you should. <img src='http://theshiftedlibrarian.com/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </li>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is an annual survey done by Dr. Scott Nicholson, associate professor at Syracuse University&#8217;s School of Information Studies, and is designed to collect information about gaming programs run in libraries in 2007.  This can be any type of game (board, card, video, chess, puzzle) at any type of library (public, school, academic, or special).  The focus is on gaming programs, where the libraries schedule an event of some type featuring games, and on gaming programs that were run sometime during the 2007 calendar year.</p>
<p>You can take this survey at <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=64bf17n2mW5s4QdKL6ctxg_3d_3d"> http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=64bf17n2mW5s4QdKL6ctxg_3d_3d</a> until the end of July.</p>
<p><a href="http://gaming.techsource.ala.org/index.php/Who_Else_Is_Playing%3F_The_Current_State_of_Gaming_in_Libraries">Data from last year&#8217;s census</a> has been valuable in helping us to understand how libraries are using gaming and to get funding for other gaming programs.  Adding data about your institution to our census will help us better understand how libraries are using data.  You can see the publications that have used this data at <a href="http://gamelab.syr.edu/publications/">http://gamelab.syr.edu/publications/</a>. The results from this survey will be presented at the <a href="http://gaming.techsource.ala.org/">2008 ALA TechSource Gaming, Learning, and Libraries Symposium</a>.</p>
<p>Questions?  Contact Scott Nicholson at <a href="mailto:srnichol@syr.edu">srnichol@syr.edu</a>. I can tell you that having this kind of data has been crucial when talking with reporters, so I hope you&#8217;ll help and fill out the form for this year&#8217;s survey. Thanks!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>does anyone care if their library records are being tracked? should they?<br />
ALA OIF has received a grant from the Open Society Institute/Soros Foundation to explore the issue of privacy in the digital age</p>
<p>Panelists: Dan Roth (Wired), Cory Doctorow (CrapHound), and Beth Givens (Privacy Rights Clearinghouse)</p>
<p><strong>Dan Roth</strong><br />
no one ever talks about privacy in his world unless he asks the questions<br />
the only time it has ever come up that he can remember was in 2005 when a company lost 600,000 employees&#8217; info (Time Warner) - happened to his parent org<br />
he talked to corporate communications, who hadn&#8217;t told anyone; they had lost the info a month before<br />
they said &#8220;we&#8217;ve only lost tapes 4 times this year&#8221;<br />
everyone at work was upset for days<br />
no one ever talked about it again &#038; people stopped talking about it<br />
and these were journalists<br />
how can your reach the public if journalists don&#8217;t care?</p>
<p>little incentive for consumers to care about privacy - not sure why they should care (except for the people in this room)<br />
beyond just the question of will a company get spanked for losing information, will consumers use it as a criterion for which companies they will deal with?<br />
some companies have said we have better privacy policies than google - you should trust us<br />
ask.com decided last year that privacy rights would set them apart<br />
- offered askeraser, where users could configure what was stored by the company<br />
but this wasn&#8217;t meaningful, and ask is still 4th or 5th in the market<br />
if you use the google toolbar, it&#8217;s collecting information about you - steve ballmer tried to make a big deal about it, but consumers didn&#8217;t care</p>
<p>cited a survey in which 75% of privacy execs said they don&#8217;t share data<br />
however, marketers share the info (some even share SSNs), so the CEOs don&#8217;t know their companies are doing this</p>
<p>the idea of the free economy - free as a business model<br />
you get something great in return for info about you<br />
they all count on ads being served up to you<br />
thinks there will be an arms race to offer more info about users, which means more collecting and more sharing<br />
this will build up to a point where we&#8217;re all completely findable online<br />
phorm - ad survey company that teams up with ISPs; tracks their users as soon as they log in until they turn off their computers and serve up ads the whole time<br />
there is no real way to opt out of it<br />
it will be very popular and is being tested in the US by Charter</p>
<p>it&#8217;s time to decide where we stand on this<br />
if we don&#8217;t want to get stuff for free in exchange for data, we need to figure out some way to tell business that we do care about it and how we want to handle it<br />
it all looks hopeless, because it looks like americans don&#8217;t care<br />
but think about 7 years ago, when only a dedicated group cared about the environment<br />
now more people care, and the same could happen with privacy<br />
hopefully we won&#8217;t have to wait a decade to find out</p>
<p><strong>Beth Givens</strong><br />
Privacy Rights Clearinghouse was established in 1992<br />
two types of privacy - informational privacy and constitutional privacy<br />
they concentrate on the former (ACLU and EFF concentrate on the latter)<br />
lines are blurred in reality, but there are too few of us all the way around<br />
provide practical information about how people can protect their identity in credit offers, medical privacy, government records, debt collection, etc. and from identity theft<br />
librarians can turn to the PRC for help with questions such as &#8220;how do I get rid of all of those credit card offers I get in the mail?&#8221;</p>
<p>a few years ago, Sun CEO Scott McNealy said &#8220;you have no privacy, get over it already&#8221;<br />
he said visa knows what I bought, someone has my medical records, someone has my dental records, etc.<br />
1967 definition of privacy - when someone can decide what information about them is transmitted to others<br />
&#8220;informational self-determination&#8221;<br />
Canada &#038; EU do a much better job than US; they have privacy commissioners and we don&#8217;t have that (no comprehensive data privacy law)<br />
instead, we have the sectoral approach - a law for this industry, another one for that industry, etc.<br />
HIPAA isn&#8217;t a privacy law, it&#8217;s a disclosure law<br />
it&#8217;s a swiss cheese approach and there are lots of holes<br />
Fair Credit Reporting Act was enacted in 1970 - wouldn&#8217;t make it out of congress today with the shape congress is in these days<br />
gives you a right of access to your credit report<br />
only creditors, employers, and landlords can access your credit report - if others access it, you can sue</p>
<p>Fair Information Practices - FIPs<br />
when she analyzes an information bill, she has a mental checklist of these things (usage, collection, access, etc.) for evaluating it<br />
most privacy policies are not really privacy policies at all - they&#8217;re disclosure policies because there&#8217;s no omnibus privacy bill on the books<br />
usually in legalese it&#8217;s difficult to understand<br />
throwing up your hands and declaring you have no privacy is not a valid option<br />
instead, we need to take every opportunity to opt out - they have a guide on their website<br />
take control of uses of your personal information<br />
that way, lobbyists can&#8217;t say to legislators that we don&#8217;t need privacy legislation because only a few people opt out<br />
in fact, let legislators know this is important to enact</p>
<p>librarians are the pioneers - use the PRC resources<br />
we can all do a better job of making sure our privacy is more protected, rather than less protected<br />
put books like Cory Doctorow&#8217;s Little Brother - as well as nonfiction - prominently on your shelves and help guide people to resources<br />
encourage users to visit the nonprofit advocacy group websites</p>
<p><strong>Cory Doctorow</strong><br />
when we say do we need to care about the privacy of our patrons in light of the fact they&#8217;re already giving away their information on social networking sites, at least sn users are deciding when to give out their personal information<br />
how can you say info is private if other people know it?<br />
well, we have private but secret acts (going to the bathroom, having sex) - this is no different</p>
<p>the further up the ladder you go and the higher up you are, the more power you have to selectively reveal information<br />
the lower you go, the less power you have to hide your info</p>
<p>is this because of bureaucrats or our technology?<br />
why do we enter the skinner box? go online and give away our information?<br />
the system architects create the system, but others create the norms for us just giving away the info without thinking about it</p>
<p>london is ground zero in the privacy wars<br />
wanted to use rfid passes instead of paper tickets - convert everyone over<br />
gave discounts to new rfid users by tripling the cost of paper tickets<br />
same thing with grocery loyalty cards<br />
aimed at people with the least choice</p>
<p>thinks there are businesses who have manipulated the field<br />
this has raised a generation where this is now par for the course and this happens all day long, and not just in commercial settings<br />
it&#8217;s become the norm because you have to know what you&#8217;re doing to turn off the logging<br />
rfids are set up so that users have no ability to configure, read, or block them<br />
vendors say this would raise the cost of rfid, which is true - the same way seatbelts, brakes, etc. raise the cost (a company couldn&#8217;t offer a car today without those things)<br />
it wouldn&#8217;t be a market correction when that company went out of business - regulators would take care of it</p>
<p>creates a climate where we have less respect for our own privacy<br />
also where malicious people can read your data and decide what to do with it</p>
<p>libraries are the last bastion of DRM - they&#8217;re not treated as first-class citizens<br />
DRM - consumption of material - a word-by-word capacity to track what people are reading<br />
we should be deeply skeptical of these technologies<br />
libraries have a moral imperative to block technologies that expose user data (embodies a snitch)</p>
<p>an information economy based on accessing information isn&#8217;t viable<br />
it&#8217;s a business model that no one wants<br />
no one woke up this morning asking to do less with their music</p>
<p>at the end of the day, this surveillance undermines our personal security and our national security<br />
surveillance societies are ones where people don&#8217;t trust each other<br />
they undermine our security because it makes our haystacks bigger without making it easier to find the needles<br />
our information officials had everything they needed to know about 9/11<br />
the mad response since then has been to make the haystacks bigger<br />
we collect the information to fill the government databases to make it harder for the government to find the critical info<br />
can&#8217;t spot the important stuff in the unimportant stuff we&#8217;ve collected</p>
<p>in the remote rail stations, we&#8217;ve replaced the guards with cameras, which are only forensic<br />
when you have that many cameras, no one watches them<br />
they don&#8217;t prevent crimes - they only help you solve them afterwards<br />
cctv is not a means to securing society<br />
crack addicts who mug and kill you for your cell phone don&#8217;t have long-term plans and cctvs don&#8217;t help with those scenarios</p>
<p>these systems that we build that provide access to this information will determine the societies we build in the future<br />
our decisions as information professionals will determine whether our descendents curse us or praise us</p>
<p><strong>Q&#038;A</strong></p>
<p>Q: what is at stake here overall?</p>
<p>Beth: there&#8217;s a huge amount at stake. if we don&#8217;t somehow succeed in getting our message across about speaking out and protecting our privacy, we&#8217;ll lose it. so much data is gathered about us, and profiles are being built now; the movie &#8220;Minority Report&#8221; is a great example of ads being tailored to you. worries the most about when all of these cameras are outfitted with biometric readers that identify the shape of our face, which hooks into the drivers license database - this is very possible and is high on her list to worry about. worried we&#8217;re heading in that direction without asking the questions and putting up the barriers</p>
<p>Dan: we&#8217;ve seen some of this already - what happens when our health records can be read by insurers and employers? what happens when you apply for a job and they can read those things? when you can&#8217;t get a drivers license because of what they know? when you can&#8217;t get married? once all of this info is out there, and if we don&#8217;t care, what happens when we develop into a nation of niches? you&#8217;re the kind of guy that shops for this one thing? as we move away from mass culture to atomization, how does having this private information out there affect us?</p>
<p>Cory: one of the important things to recognzie about this data acquisition is that it&#8217;s like uranium. you can buy it on amazon for your science project, and it&#8217;s perfectly legal. but you can refine it into plutonium and this is a problem. a little of your private information is one thing, but you can quickly amass a lot of private information in the public domain without even knowing it. the internet will never unlearn what paris hilton&#8217;s genitals look like. these things never go back in the bottle. you will never be able to not look up what CEOs of companies were posting on usenet in the 90s. as we confront the potential of our society in 20 years, all of this info will be like smog and we won&#8217;t be able to destroy it</p>
<p>dan: we&#8217;re in a golden age right now where most companies don&#8217;t know what to do with all of this info they have. they just keep collecting it, but at some point they&#8217;ll figure it out. if something is going to happen, it has to happen now</p>
<p>cory: or it&#8217;s like the breakup of the soviet union, where you could buy the plutonium easily. cited a situation where selling blade servers came with the info on it. you&#8217;re loading the gun and handing it to successors forever</p>
<p>beth: recommends the &#8220;Dig Dirt&#8221; report/survey about how employers are using social network sites and other information as a hiring tool (more than 50%) and making value judgments about individuals and keeping this to themselves. doesn&#8217;t apply to privacy or employment laws. old laws are inadequate for covering this kind of thing. let young people know, even though it might not do any good because they may not listen</p>
<p>Q (Jessamyn): these databases exist - we know that. at what point do we either have to say the horse is out of the barn or that there are assurances about things happening? if we&#8217;re just waiting for the processors to hit the point where they can use the data, do we need a new strategy about serious top-down legislation? is there any purpose to doing something other than top-level stuff</p>
<p>cory: calls it &#8220;turning forward the clock,&#8221; not &#8220;turning back the clock.&#8221; we&#8217;re going to regulate how this is used and teach people how to use it. respecting the awesome power of information and regulating this activity. could trivially build a skinner box that rewarded people for protecting their privacy and in fact justin hall is working on this with pmog - the passively multiplayer online gaming (<a href="http://pmog.com/">http://pmog.com/</a>)</p>
<p>dan: looking for the transparency side. if we care about this as a society, we have to keep at this and find ways to make it happen. use game theory to your advantage to encourage people to do this. consumers don&#8217;t have any idea why they should care about this and you have to teach them why they do</p>
<p>beth: very few people take advantage of the opportunity to view their credit reports. try to get the right of access into law now, because it doesn&#8217;t exist. PRC tried to do this last year but failed in california because of the information and credit industries. couldn&#8217;t get past the committee hearings. have to keep trying. counting on a &#8220;data valdez&#8221; doesn&#8217;t work because we&#8217;ve had one after another (their website keeps track of these security breaches - a running tally). when more people realize that the decision made about them (job, insurance, etc.) was caused by personal information that is out of their control, it will help energize them, but it&#8217;s difficult. california is a trendsetter in terms of legislation, but the information broker industry is fighting &#038; blocking this legislation</p>
<p>cory: other tips and tricks that make it easier to game the system - skipxxip (sp?) generates fake logins for registration sites. every time he gets a postal solicitation, he writes &#8220;deceased&#8221; on it and sends it back</p>
<p>Q kate sheehan (blogger): about 8-9 years ago, Wired ran an article about how to be invisible online. is it even feasible anymore? is it even a good idea to try to make yourself invisible or to manage it? how do you buy a house then?</p>
<p>beth: &#8220;how to be invisible&#8221; book. can&#8217;t be invisible because then someone else has to manage your mail. that&#8217;s why she&#8217;s a public activist. remember the unabomber? he owned the cabin so records showed that and even he couldn&#8217;t be invisible</p>
<p>cory: thinks it&#8217;s just bad tactics; shift over the last few years is that &#8220;green can be glorious&#8221; - doesn&#8217;t involve suffering or eating food that tastes bad; being green can actually help us personally - there&#8217;s an imaginative opportunity to come up with cool ways to make privacy luxurious</p>
<p>dan: would like to see a point where you can figure out what is being trapped and what you&#8217;re giving away. try to read the privacy policies of a lot of websites and they&#8217;re incomprehensible</p>
<p>beth: that&#8217;s why the right of access would be very valuable - to see what is held about us</p>
<p>dan: the one story he did about privacy, he talked to HP&#8217;s chief privacy officer. she described the amount of work HP does to keep user data private in the EU, but not in the US because we don&#8217;t require it. wasn&#8217;t a no-brainer to just do it here since they were already doing it there</p>
<p>cory: defaults matter. if a router came with logging off by default (or apache) and you had to explicitly turn it on, we&#8217;d have a very different world. push legislation and best practices. firefox could do more to surface what information about you is being given away. linux could expose info. the open source world in particular could help with this by setting the defaults to off. there&#8217;s a really good inflection/leverage point there by just talking to some geeks in the right way</p>
<p>Q: as librarians, people come into our institutions, how do we convince our users that privacy is important in the age of facebook? what do we do?</p>
<p>cory: friend of his is a hacker who built the &#8220;hackerbot&#8221; - a robot sat on the floor on the ground with a router on it and it would sniff the area networks and grab unencrypted passwords. it would roll up to your feet and show you all of the passwords you just transmitted; a library that had over the door a printer that showed all of the info you disclosed would be very powerful. having slider bars that show red/green for amount of disclosure</p>
<p>beth: described a game that could be used in libraries. it&#8217;s a town square where you&#8217;re challenged about privacy data and questions you can answer. can come up with creative ways to educate and inform people; use the library as a launching pad</p>
<p>cory: in a few years, teachers will be able to datamine info about their students as a very instructive lesson</p>
<p>dan: require that everyone check out cory&#8217;s books</p>
<p>Q kate sheehan: we&#8217;re very concerned about privacy, so we don&#8217;t let users see everything they&#8217;ve ever checked out. we&#8217;re protecting their privacy, but they want to access that info. her library has the ability for the user to turn this on so they see it and staff don&#8217;t, but most libraries don&#8217;t have that. how do we balance this?</p>
<p>cory: demand of vendors ways they collect information for only the user to access. maybe the data resides only on their library card and not on your server. stuff can live on the edges - doesn&#8217;t have to live in the middle, and it can be encrypted. it&#8217;s utterly conceivable that if there was demand for it, vendors would produce the solutions</p>
<p>cory made an explicit statement that all of his remarks are in the public domain!</p>
<p>q: how do we argue for this when privacy protections cost money?</p>
<p>beth: could try scare tactics. the more you collect, the more the risk it can get breached. larry ponemon (sp?) has calculated the cost of data breaches ($100-200 cost per name per data breach). the lesson many of these entities have learned is that if we hadn&#8217;t collected all of this stuff, we wouldn&#8217;t be in trouble now. don&#8217;t keep data for very long</p>
<p>cory: has a friend who described a conversation with a self-defense instructor. what do I do if I&#8217;m in a dark alley when two guys are following me and I&#8217;m alone? answer - don&#8217;t go to dark alleys alone</p>
<p>q: as a consumer, i was better able to manage my privacy before 9/11 and before I bought a house. now my info is everywhere. how do I manage this?</p>
<p>beth: in terms of property, create a living trust and don&#8217;t put it in your name - this will protect you from real estate ledgers. start young on this one. this is good in general - just have a PO box - so that it becomes habitual. this is why working with young people is so important.</p>
<p>q: but traditional things like banking require a physical address and a Social Security number</p>
<p>cory: need to take control of your technology; jailbreaking drm; take control of debate &#038; learn to speak intelligently about this; danah boyd shows a slide on online predation and how rare these occurrences are - knowing how to speak about the issue is key. third thing is regime change - if you don&#8217;t participate in the electoral process, it will participate in you</p>
<p>q: one of the big worries we&#8217;re facing today is that after 9/11, there is increased access by government to library information. there is a certain logic to the idea that we&#8217;ll be safe if we just give up our privacy. how much safer would we really be if the government knew everything everyone was reading?</p>
<p>dan: thinks people are starting to say that all of data collection this hasn&#8217;t helped us at all</p>
<p>cory: safety and security are not platonic universals. you can only be safe by definition from something. if you&#8217;re going to be made more safe from terrorists, you have to be less safe from government. this is at odds with the founding principle of this country. if you believe the former, you should go back to the soviet union. saying we are taking away your freedom to keep you safe from terrorism is a fundamentally unamerican premise</p>
<p>q: we have this huge cult of celebrity that everyone feeds into where it&#8217;s a cool thing to divulge this information. there has to be a shift for librarians to educate people if there&#8217;s a drive to not give out that info. would need a celebrity campaign to counter the norm</p>
<p>beth: that&#8217;s a great idea, especially for the long-term consequences</p>
<p>dan: saw this happen in a story about a secretive billionaire. guy purchased a company and never talked to the press. his daughter had a blogging site, though, where she talked about her parents and the fights they&#8217;d get into, what she overheard them saying. it revealed a lot about this guy and it enabled dan to approach him to say here&#8217;s what I know about you. that blog *stopped* as soon as the guy found out about it</p>
<p>q: transparency has ebbed and flowed across history and we&#8217;ll never have absolute privacy. we need to assert positive rights for privacy. how do we watch the watchers and take care of the positive ways?</p>
<p>cory: his daughter is 5-months old, but their first game will probably be 10p for every cctv you spot. wants to make a campaign of post-it notes with closed eyes on them that people can put on cctv cameras - &#8220;don&#8217;t watch me&#8221;</p>
<p>jessamyn: demystifying the media and telling people that it&#8217;s okay to not always believe the newspapers and magazines</p>
<p>q: it would be useful for us as a community to look at the successes of the green revolution and how it evolved, maybe piggyback on it. is our &#8220;inconvenient truth&#8221; &#8220;information footprints&#8221; instead of &#8220;carbon footprints?&#8221; get our own al gore and make our own movies. let&#8217;s build on that</p>
<p>dan: will have a problem convincing people not to opt-in to things they use everyday, though</p>
<p>cory: there&#8217;s a third option between refusenik and throwing up your hands - take control of your habits; use &#8220;google commander&#8221; firefox extension; in the library, we could redirect doubeclick URLs to 0000 so that library users are not tracked</p>
<p>dan: digital vandalism would make this info useless - a friend clicks around aimlessly to deliberately create false data</p>
<p>q: how can we work better with our IT people? and our vendors? what would be persuasive to the geeks who design our systems?</p>
<p>cory: is a former sysadmin and geeks believe really strongly in privacy for themselves. if you can get those people to expand the universe of people whose privacy they want to protect beyond themselves, they can understand it&#8217;s part of their mission</p>
<p>q: the EFF has the Tor program that can be downloaded for free to anonymize web surfing and can be used on library computers, too, if your IT people install it</p>
<p>cory: it was originally intended for naval communications</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been invited to liveblog and solicit questions for an Annual Conference session about a newish ALA grant project designed to educate the public about privacy rights. More info will be up soon at their site, <a href="http://privacyrevolution.org/">Privacy Revolution</a>, but for now, they have a top-notch panel speaking about this subject at Annual (<a href="http://craphound.com/">Cory Doctorow</a>, <a href="http://www.danielroth.net/">Dan Roth</a> from <a href="http://wired.com/">Wired</a>, and <a href="http://www.privacyrights.org/about_us.htm#staff">Beth Givens</a>, the director of the <a href="http://www.privacyrights.org/">Privacy Rights Clearinghouse</a>), and they&#8217;re soliciting questions from those who can&#8217;t attend the session. If nothing else, there is a survey available on the site that they&#8217;re hoping you&#8217;ll take in order to collect data about information privacy policies and practices.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.librarian.net/stax/2318/blogging-the-ala-privacy-panel/">Jessamyn West has a longer explanation on Librarian.net</a>, and I think it&#8217;s probably easier if everyone just posts their questions there, although I will definitely ask any relevant questions posted here, too. If you&#8217;ll be at the conference, we&#8217;ll be in room 201D in the convention center from 1:30-3:30pm on Sunday, so please join us.</p>
<p>As soon as there is more info about the project available online, I&#8217;ll post a note about it here. I&#8217;m hoping good things will come from this, as I think this country needs to have a serious and frank debate about privacy issues, and I believe libraries are a good forum for this.</p>

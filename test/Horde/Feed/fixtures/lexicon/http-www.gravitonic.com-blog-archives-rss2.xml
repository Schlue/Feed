<title>GeekSessions Talk and Slides</title>
<link>http://www.gravitonic.com/blog/archives/000435.html</link>
<description>This past Tuesday I was a co-presenter at GeekSessions, an event that brings together speakers on a particular topic and the audience interested in it, or, as their site says, "a place with smart people and free beer." This Geeksessions event was, of course, centered on PHP and the other speakers were Cal Henderson of Flickr, Lucas Nealan of Facebook, and Sara Golemon of Yahoo!. We each had 15 minutes, but everyone had excellent talks given the time constraints.

<title>New Year, New Photos</title>

<description>I've just uploaded some photos taken over the New Year's eve period. One album is from a pre-party at my friends' place, and the other from the awesome Sea of Dreams event at the SF Concourse center. I had a lot of fun shooting both events, and a lot of it was due to my new camera acquisition - Nikon D3 - with its absolutely amazing performance in low-light situations.

<p>Anyway, what I really wanted to say is that Plaxo Pulse fails. Out of the gate. Dead on arrival. Why? Well, ever since it launched I've been receiving notices that such-and-such has added me as friend or wants to add me as a business contact. These notices provide a link to go to Pulse site and confirm the connection. Not recognizing one of the names, I decided to clicke on the link to check it out, but all I saw was a page that said, "Not a member yet? Sign up!"  Are you freaking kidding me? You expect me to sign up just to see who wanted to add me as a contact? No thanks, Pulse. You lost me at "click here".</p><div class="feedflare">

<description>Ed Finkler, or funkatron, as he prefers to be known (although I'll have to investigate this claim of "tron"ing the "funk"), put up a Guide to php|works Atlanta. He has good judgement to highlight both of my talks (your pick of a beer at the conference, Ed). Apparently, Matt Mullenweg won't like whatever it is I have to say in my keynote, which means I can make whatever extravagant claims I want.

<p>So I was going to write a long post, nay, multiple long posts about my new job, moving to San Francisco, how cool my new place is, how much I love living here, etc, etc, etc. You know, the usual stuff from someone who moves from suburbia of South Bay to the coolest city in the country. But I'll save you the grief of reading through that and summarize:<ol><li>My new job (at Outspark) is cool. I get to build platforms to support games that we publish and all these games include some type of social interaction. So, Web 2.0 + games = profit!</li><br />
<li>Our first game &mdash; Fiesta &mdash; is blazing through our target demographic like Homer Simpson through week-old donut bucket behind Kwik-E-Mart.</li><br />
<li>San Francisco rocks. You should try living here at least once.</li><br />
<li>On second thought, no, don't try living here, it's crowded and expensive enough as-is. You can visit, but if you do, please, never, ever call it San Fran. Or SF. Or, heaven forbid, Frisco. The locals call it "the city", but for you it's San Francisco. St. Francis of Assisi, mkay? Welcome.</li><br />
<li>You should <a href="http://www.jpgmag.com/photos/223625">vote for my submission</a> to the Passport theme photo contest at JPG Mag. Really. All the cool kids are doing it.</li><br />
</ol></p>

 <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/andreiz/1116623417" title="Cowgirl Creamery" style="border: none"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1161/1116623417_afd149577d_m.jpg" alt="Cowgirl Creamery" style="border: solid 1px #000;" /></a>
</div>

<p>Let's move on to the real topic. Even before I moved to the city, I kept hearing that the <a href="http://www.ferrybuildingmarketplace.com/farmers_market.php">Ferry Plaza Farmers Market</a> is something to be experienced. So this past weekend, I got up early enough (yes, 10 am, I blame my co-workers for the previous night) and went to "experience" it. My place is just over a mile from the Ferry Building and it's a very nice walk along Embarcadero and all the piers. Just beautiful, especially on a cool, breezy morning.</p>

<p>The market itself is outside, along the front of the building, but most of it is on the rear plaza overlooking the Bay. Walking through it is enough to make you salivate: fresh vegetables piled high on the tables, golden honey glistening under the sun, heirloom tomatoes showing their multi-hued juiciness to the public. I saw a stall that sold not fewer than 6 different types of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluot">pluot</a>. I tasted (and bought) Snow Giant white peaches that were so sweet and tender that you don't even have to chew them. I lost count of the word "organic" written on the product signs. And if you tire or get hungry, like I did, just walk to one of the food stalls on the south side, get yourself a nice California-style omelet, salad, or sandwich, and enjoy it while sitting by the water and thinking how awesome this place is.</p>

<div style="float: right; margin: 3px 0 0 10px;">
 <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/andreiz/1116622953" title="Caviar Cafe" style="border: none"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1258/1116622953_cdbfd701d5_m.jpg" alt="Caviar Cafe" style="border: solid 1px #000;" /></a>
</div>

<p>Still with me? Good, it's not over yet. There's also the <a href="http://www.ferrybuildingmarketplace.com/">Ferry Building</a> itself, which I can unabashedly and without slightest exaggeration call "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foodie">foodie</a> heaven". From <a href="http://www.ferrybuildingmarketplace.com/cowgirl_creamery.php">Cowgirl Creamery</a>, making dozens of varieties of cheeses and creams, to <a href="http://www.ferrybuildingmarketplace.com/iperferiti_boriana.php">I Preferiti di Boriana</a>, giving you a taste of Tuscany, to <a href="http://www.ferrybuildingmarketplace.com/recchiuti_confections.php">Recchiuti Confections</a>, that looks nothing more like Apple Store, but for chocolates. And then there is <a href="http://www.ferrybuildingmarketplace.com/tsar_nicoulai_caviar.php">Tsar Nicoulai Caviar Cafe</a>, which surprised even me with their selection. Plus, there are restaurants, cafes, wine shop, gelateria, and even a bookshop, to complete the picture. Quite awesome, to sum it up, and a great place to spend a few hours. Or a day. And a bunch of your money. The only other place I've seen anything like it is Paris.</p>

<p>Granted, Mountain View Farmers Market is quite good and is cheaper. But then, it is in Mountain View.</p>

<p>So if you do visit San Francisco &mdash; or if you live here, but haven't bothered to visit the market &mdash; do yourself a favor and get over to Ferry Building on a nice Saturday morning. You won't regret it.</p><div class="feedflare">

<title>Conference Update</title>
<link>http://www.gravitonic.com/blog/archives/000427.html</link>
<description>It looks like the rest of the year will be pretty busy with conferences. First up is php|works in Atlanta, coming up in September, where I will be giving the opening keynote as well as the popular VIM for (PHP) Programmers talk. The week after that, I was invited to present at the TYPO3 conference in Karlsruhe Germany. In October, I will give the Internationalization with PHP 6 talk at ZendCon, which, thankfully, is only about 15 miles away, and finally, at the end of November, I'll present the same talk to the audience at the AFUP Forum in Paris....</description>

The goals of this photoblog, however, are different: I simply want to  post a daily quality photo, independent of when it was taken, and make the presentation somewhat better than what Flickr allows.</p>

<p>Getting the actual site built has taken a while, but it's finally here: <a href="http://10fathoms.org/vu">Vu</a>. I called it that for a couple of reasons: it sounds like <i>view</i> and <i>vu</i> in French means <i>seen</i>. All the photos are hosted on <a href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</a>, so you can always click through to the image page via the "on flickr" link. The design might evolve slightly, and I'll add a couple of cool extra features, but I'm very happy that it's up and running and that I can share some of my favorite photos.</p>

<p>I hope you <a href="http://10fathoms.org/vu">enjoy it</a>.</p><div class="feedflare">

<description>Sometime in the past couple of weeks, there apparently has been an attack on my domain, most likely via DNS cache poisoning. The end result was that a large number of visitors to the site saw some infelicitous pr0n content, instead of the usual blog. Rest assured, it was not an attempt on my part to make some extra cash by displaying someone else's fleshy bits to drooling eager masses. No, there are easier ways of getting beer money.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometime in the past couple of weeks, there apparently has been an attack on my domain, most likely via <a href="http://www.secureworks.com/research/articles/dns-cache-poisoning/">DNS cache poisoning</a>. The end result was that a large number of visitors to the site saw some infelicitous pr0n content, instead of the usual blog. Rest assured, it was not an attempt on my part to make some extra cash by displaying someone else's fleshy bits to drooling eager masses. No, there are easier ways of getting beer money. I am not sure whether this was a deliberate attack or whether my domain was simply unfortunate enough to get on someone's list, but I sincerely apologize to those of you who were exposed &mdash; pun intended &mdash; to that content.</p>

<p>I have taken steps to fix the DNS issues and make sure that this kind of thing would be very hard to repeat. Unfortunately, during this time the search engines, such as Yahoo! and Google, have indexed the pr0n content under as though belonging to my domain and it might take a few days for it to clear out. Meanwhile, I hope you will return and check out some cool new things that should be coming shortly.</p><div class="feedflare">

<title>Presumption of uncluefulness</title>

<description>PHP internals mailing list has been filled with massive threads lately, mostly concerning PHP 6. Nothing too surprising in the amount, topics, or quality of polemic there, but I just love it when someone pipes in with a post like this: I don't really know much about topic X, and to be honest, I don't really know much about the internal workings of php. I'm going to suggest an implementation suggestion...

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://news.php.net/php.internals">PHP internals mailing list</a> has been filled with massive threads lately, mostly concerning PHP 6. Nothing too surprising in the amount, topics, or quality of polemic there, but I just love it when someone pipes in with a post like this:</p>

<blockquote class="cite">

<p>I don't really know much about <b>topic X</b>, and to be honest, I don't really<br />
know much about the internal workings of php. I'm going to suggest an implementation suggestion... Keep in mind I havent<br />
hacked around with php source, so my variable naming etc will be wrong...<br />
and its all psuedocode, so its not</p>

<p><code>[a page of C++ snipped]</code></p>

<p>I think this would provide a very fast implementation of what is trying to<br />
be done.</p>

<p>Im just making a suggestion, and feel free to ignore/criticise me if im<br />
wrong.  I don't know anything about phps internals... Just an idea<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>That's just awesome. We totally haven't considered that before, but your brilliant, yet humble and self-deprecating idea has shined new light onto the issue. Don't worry about PHP internals, it's just some hackish code we had lying around.</p>

<p>I just have to wonder why someone would post this without bothering to research the issue at hand for at least 15 minutes. It'd be like me going to the space shuttle designers and saying, "Hey, I know I don't have a degree in rocket engineering and it's just an idea, but that problem with the insulation foam you're having.. have you thought about putting some duct tape on it?"</p>

<p>Every message like this leads me to change my default presumptions about the cluefulness of the new posters to the list, and unfortunately, not in a better direction.</p><div class="feedflare">

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Having forgotten to check my baggage all the way through to Rarotonga, I had to pick it up in AA terminal and go over to Air New Zealand one. While standing in the check-in line, I realized with absolute and frightening clarity that there was another small, yet vitally essential thing I forgot at home. My green card. For those of you lucky enough not to need one, I'm required to have it with me at all times, especially when entering back into USA. The green card was tucked into the back pocket of my Uzbek passport cover, and I completely forgot about it, since I took my Russian passport on the trip.</p>

<p>I could just imagine the kind of hassle I'd have to go through at the immigration checkpoint; that is, if they let me into the country at all. My mind was in overdrive, as I walked through the security in haze and went up to the Air New Zealand lounge (that Premier Exec status sure comes in handy, thanks to all the conferences). The lounge had phones (remember, no cell phone with me), and computers (with Firefox on them!). While talking on the phone to my Mom, I hit upon a possible solution.</p>

<p>Observation of the day: <a href="http://webmessenger.yahoo.com">Web Messenger</a> is the coolest thing since the ice hotel in Sweden.</p>

<p>I fired it up, saw that my friend Brien was online, and asked him a favor: go to my apartment, enter the code into the lockbox to get the key, come in, find the green card, and fax a copy of it to me in Cook Islands. This was a tall order, but Brien didn't even think twice. Hopefully by tomorrow I'll have some sort of proof that I'm not faking being a permanent resident. Not sure if it'll be enough to reduce that hassle, but it's better than nothing.</p>

<p>With that completed, I could finally go and enjoy the lounge, get some food (the crab salad at the buffet was fantastic), and some New Zealand wine (best one was Ngatarawa Glazebrook Merlot Cabernet). I have to say that this lounge is way ahead of the ones I've been to in SFO, HKG, or FRA. Kudos to Air New Zealand.</p><div class="feedflare">

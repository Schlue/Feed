		<title>Underwear</title>
		<description><![CDATA[One of my happiest memories is the day I quit my job. No longer was I a mere office shlub, meekly thanking life for the cold mashed potatoes it deigned to drop onto my plate. I was somebody now—somebody with a destiny. I was a web designer. Times being what they are, more and more of us are working at home, not always by choice.

		<title>Customer support on the march</title>
		<description><![CDATA[You know that new thing where you call customer support and a robot tells you that there's no need to wait; just leave your phone number and you'll be called back in three minutes? So you do it, and three minutes later, the robot calls you back and asks you to hold while your call is connected? And then you sit on hold for twenty minutes waiting to get connected? ]]></description>

		<title>Around the Word with Web Talent</title>
		<description><![CDATA[My first book didn't sell very well but it had an effect on people's hearts. Web designers around the world circulated a single copy of <cite>Taking Your Talent to the Web</cite>, adding their autographs, drawings, photos, and other verbal and visual messages to every page—even the covers and spine. ]]></description>

		<title>Life Needs a Rewind Button</title>
		<description><![CDATA[The new office is so new to me that I entered the address incorrectly while ordering CS3 suites for the studio. Amazon is consequently rush-delivering Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Flash, Dreamweaver, Acrobat Pro, and Fireworks to the wrong address, and it's too late to change the address on the order. Someone in Harlem is going to be very happy.]]></description>

		<title>What happened here</title>
		<description><![CDATA[This gently declining space that has been nothing but an office since December and will soon be nothing at all to me, this place I will empty and vacate in the next few hours, has seen everything from drug withdrawal to the first stirrings of childbirth. Happiness, anguish, farting and honeymoons. Everything. Everything but death.]]></description>

		<title>Art direction on the web?</title>
		<description><![CDATA[On Tuesday morning, while Malarkey was furiously getting himself permanently uninvited to Håkon Lie’s Christmas parties, and the jungle drums spoke of nothing but Firefox 3, Jason Santa Maria quietly slipped a torpedo into the harbor. He didn’t just redesign his website, he issued a call to arms. And what he called for was real art direction on the web.]]></description>

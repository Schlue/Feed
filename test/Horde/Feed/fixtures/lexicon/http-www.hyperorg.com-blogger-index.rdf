	<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blog.jonudell.net/2008/07/17/dan-bricklin-on-becoming-a-happy-caster/">Jon Udell talks about his interview</a> of <a href="http://www.bricklin.com/">Dan Bricklin</a><a href="http://www.bricklin.com/"></a> in which about Dan talks about his experience entering the world of audio. Jon says:</p>
<blockquote><p>When I embarked on my personal audio adventure a few years ago, I naively thought that our fancy new digital technologies would make the whole process very simple. Boy, was I wrong about that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a coda, Jon uses the story of the production of of that very interview as an example of the routine complexities of audio.</p>
<p>Too true. I&#8217;m often tempted to record an interview but then I remember just what a pain in the butt it would be to edit it, even with my very low standards for audio quality. </p>
<p>So, is there something wrong with the idea of writing software that:</p>
<p>1. Converts spoken audio into text (presumably using existing tools)</p>
<p>2. Lets you use an editor to delete pieces of the text and move other pieces around, as you would with a low-end word processor</p>
<p>3. Uses the edited text to edit and output the audio</p>
<p>Even if Step 1 worked only moderately well, this application would turn editing spoken audio into a trivial task, no harder than (in fact, exactly the same as) editing a text file.</p>
<p>Does this software exist? Is there a good reason why it doesn&#8217;t, shouldn&#8217;t or couldn&#8217;t?</p>

	<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I read something like today&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/21/business/media/21papers.html">news</a> that only 10% of American newspaper editors consider foreign news to be &#8220;very essential&#8221; to their coverage, I instinctively turn to the bloggers who I know will have something enlightening, thoughtful and sometimes profound to say. And that by itself says a lot about how news is changing.</p>
<p>Of course, I did read that particular news in a newspaper, although I was referred there by a blog aggregator. So, I&#8217;m not saying that professional news media are unnecessary or add nothing. Not at all. But the news ecology in just a few years has become 100% mixed.</p>

Currently in beta, it&#8217;s designed to let anyone upload any magazine or magazine article, and then share the content, using the familiar elements of content-based social networking sites (or, more accurately, the social networking elements of content-based sites). </p>
<p><P>The site unfortunately has little information about itself, so I don&#8217;t know what they think they&#8217;re going to do about the obvious copyright issues. The existing content  includes the magazines&#8217; ads, so maybe the site hopes publishers will see some benefit in being scanned &#8216;n&#8217; read. (As an example, here&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.mygazines.com/magazines/view/792">link</a> to the complete contents of the current issue of The New Yorker.)</p>
<p><P>While the tool for reading is pretty slick, the process of posting to enable said slickness seems pretty onerous.</p>

<p>In fact, we just bought the &#8220;light&#8221; version of it, which is therefore some sort of simulacrum of the original. I can&#8217;t figure out whether its name should therefore be:</p>
<p>1. &#8220;I Can&#8217;t Believe I Can&#8217;t Believe It&#8217;s Not Butter&#8221;</p>
<p>2. &#8220;I Can&#8217;t Believe It&#8217;s Not Not Butter&#8221;</p>

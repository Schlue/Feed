<title>Kuro5hin's spamming shithead: newb4b0</title>
<link>http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2008/7/19/1133/25779</link>
<description>Kuron newb4b0's latest diary is an open invitation for all other members to engage in a bit of troll-sodomy just for the kicks-da-shit fun which can be derived from sledge-hammering the ignoranus that passes for his brain.  Have a Free-Troll-Fest on me.  You want live-bait? Coming at you after the intro.</description>

<title>Trailer Trash Summer Reading: the best FP stories of 2007</title>
<link>http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2008/7/18/174545/502</link>
<description>OK I am bored this weekend and decided to update THE NOW FOREVER DEAD KO4TING WEBSITE.    Weekends @ Kuro5hin are almost as dead as Ko4ting. If you are bored this weekend too and care to do some Summer reading, go through the following FP stories of 2007. I would post a poll but there were 45 FP stories in 2007 and the poll does not have that many choices to make.    I will post in the ghetto the WINNARS after the story dumps (I would cancel at some point but you know how that goes).</description>

<title>Patent Status of MPEG-1,H.261 and MPEG-2</title>
<link>http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2008/7/18/232618/312</link>
<description>Over 100 million DVD players have shipped in the US, and  100s of millions of mp3 players have shipped, yet Linux distributions  like Fedora,  Ubuntu  and Opensuse  don't include software to create files that these devices can play. The  reason is because  implementations of the MPEG-2 and MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3 (MP3) are  considered patented so the Linux Distributors are avoiding a risk of  patent infringement lawsuits. I went searching for answers to basic  questions like what are  all the patents claimed for MP3 and when do the claimed MPEG-2 patents  expire and I did not find these on the web, so I decided to create this  summary of the patent status of MPEG-1, H.261 and MPEG-2. I'm not a  lawyer and I'm  not an expert on video or audio compression so there are probably some  mistakes in this, but its better than anything I've found on the  internet. This  article is US specific, but the patent databases listed usually have  other countries patents listed as well.</description>

<title>Eulogy for George Carlin*</title>
<link>http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2008/6/23/2051/34052</link>
<description>We join with Catholics and countless others throughout our Diocese and world in giving thanks for the extraordinary life and ministry of Pope John Paul II George Carlin, and in praying for the repose of his noble soul body. It is fitting that Our Holy Father George Carlin was called to eternal life death during the week day when we celebrate the Easter Feast of St. Thomas More, which puts the reality of death religion into perspective.</description>

<title>The Truth About John McCain</title>
<link>http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2008/6/21/4349/73033</link>
<description>I send this message out to all AMERICANS who are concerned about the dire choice we face in this election. I don't think I need to explain to all of you what the stakes are. We are currently locked in a WAR for the culture and faith of this great nation and are stuck with two phenomenally awful choices.  But while the myriad SINS of Barack HUSSEIN Obama are well known to the majority of AMERICANS, less is known about the extremely suspect background of John SIDNEY McCain, the supposed candidate of the REPUBLICAN party. The MAINSTREAM MEDIA have done a shameful job vetting this man (if he can even be called that) and are engaged in ACTIVE SUPPRESSION of many troubling items on John SIDNEY McCain's record.  However, the MAINSTREAM MEDIA cannot suppress the truth. All of the information below has been testified to in a COURT OF LAW under oath on the very BIBLE itself. Please read it and consider; can we really afford to have a man with the character of John SIDNEY McCain in the WHITE HOUSE?  </description>

<title>Tomatoes: not coming back</title>
<link>http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2008/6/16/145231/571</link>
<description>A notice posted on the door to my local McDonalds announced that it, as a corporation, "supports" the FDA's latest contamination scare regarding tomatoes and salmonella, and as a result they have "voluntarily" and "temporarily" stopped serving tomatoes on sandwiches that formerly contained them. This is "temporary" only in the same sense that all other earthly things are temporary. They will never return.</description>

<title>Microsoft Plays Dirty With Gmail</title>
<link>http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2008/6/14/24746/7652</link>
<description>A friend sent out the latest clip for Ghost Humpers, our episodic mockumentary. Downloading the quicktime movie from Gmail gave me a compressed version. I thought that was odd. After a little searching, I found an option to download attachments as a zip file. Simply replace "disp=attd" with "disp=zip" in the attachment URL. IE7 was changing this to "disp=indzip" for the same result; on its own. This piqued my curiosity.</description>

<description>The recently-deployed "Twat-o-Tron", a nifty little script that regurgitates pieces of the incoherent xenophobic rants that usually infest the BBC's Have Your Say website, is increasing in popularity after a report on The Register brought wider exposure of the tool to the Internet community.   </description>

<title>Brewing your own hobo-wine on todays subprime mortgage budget</title>
<link>http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2008/6/3/203715/0995</link>
<description>Recently GhostOfTiber posted a story about brewing your own beer. &amp;nbsp;  I say, if you're going for the real hobo/homeowner experience, just brew wine, it's easier, and I'm fucking lazy. &amp;nbsp;Also, wine takes about 2 weeks to ferment, none of this worrying about carbonation or anything, let's just get lit!    If you actually care about the way things taste, you might want to make some GhostOfTiber Ale and drink that until you no longer taste things, but that's entirely your prerogative...</description>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I had lunch with Christine McDonnell, Vice President of Existing Business &#038; Entrepreneurship - Economic Development at the <a href="http://www.nashvillechamber.com/">Nashville Chamber of Commerce</a>, and Eric Cromwell, President and CEO of the <a href="http://tntechnology.org">Tennessee Technology Development Corporation</a> at Bricktops to discuss <a href="http://podcampnashville.com">PodCamp</a>, <a href="http://barcampnashville.com">BarCamp</a> and how all of these organizations (or un-organizations in BarCamp&#8217;s case) could come together to improve the situation for technology entrepreneurs in Tennessee. They were both very passionate and enthusiastic about what is being done at BarCamp, and they both have some great ideas of there own on how we could utilize our strengths to really make a difference here.</p>
<p>I understand this plight all too well, as I was launching my fledgling company &#8220;<a href="http://remarkablewit.com">Remarkable Wit</a>&#8221; (which is now holding its own), I found it very hard to convey the essence of my company to potential funders. Now, I&#8217;m kind of happy it worked out the way it did because it forced me to get some real revenue and prove my model in order to survive, but I have a lot more credence in town than many other aspiring hackers/entrepreneurs and I can see why so many start-ups never start up. There really does need to be more communication between those of us in the know, and those who have the means to enable those in the know. I know of a few startups right now that should be off the ground, but they just haven&#8217;t gotten their funding secured yet. It&#8217;s a bit to frustrating to watch, honestly.</p>
<p>Having lunch with them really made me proud of the work that the <a href="http://conference.meetup.com/3/members/">BarCamp Nashville Crew</a> has done thus far to promote and celebrate Internet focused communities and companies in Middle Tennessee. I think there may be very good things that come from this meeting, and I applaud the Chamber and TTDC for reaching out to us to seek a way to work together. I&#8217;m predicting more great events and forums in the future, held in our beautiful city of Nashville.<!--51f7dda0b4a8684df95dbafe5a7813b7--><!--9428731a5462e0f8c4fded096a761e12--><!--557fe015bb38c195dee8dcafde15b24b--><br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just want to thank everyone who believed that I could do this. 2008 is looking like an incredible year for business, and for every &#8220;good luck&#8221; and &#8220;we know you can do it&#8221; that I received I humbly offer a single &#8220;Thank You&#8221; in return.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m doing a few things in the next few weeks that I want to highlight:</p>
<p>- Making my first full time job offer to a great guy for the position of Senior Developer at <a href="http://remarkablewit.com">Remarkable Wit</a>. (Fingers Crossed!!!)<br />
- Interviewing <a href="http://andigutmans.blogspot.com/">Andi Gutmans</a> from <a href="http://zend.com">Zend</a>, again <img src='http://www.marcuswhitney.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  This time for a podcast Remarkable Wit is going to launch on all web technologies.<br />
- Kicking off two incredibly cool projects with <a href="http://remarkablewit.com">Remarkable Wit</a>, and I&#8217;ll launch an official site for RW.<br />
- Attending, Hosting and Enjoying &#8220;<a href="http://podcampnashville.com">PodCamp Nashville</a>&#8221;<br />
- Visiting my new favorite place on Earth, <a href="http://www.santamonica.com/">Santa Monica</a>, for the fourth time in five months.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also nearly doubled my Facebook friends with old high school friends that I am so happy to be reconnected with. Facebook really is fresh.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just such a great time. 2008 is bringing the love.<!--090acf5eff34eaa050ff6fd317dcffcb-->

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Warning - This is a blog post, not a press release. Please forgive the run-ons or the soapbox.<br />
&#8220;Plan, Build and Share&#8221; are the <strong><em>service pillars</em></strong> of my new business venture. When I decided to start my own business I knew that no matter what I did, certain things were going to be an absolute requirement. Effective and reliable support, outstanding customer service, and a trustworthy brand are basics that ought to be present in any venture you do. Service pillars of your business are something different. They are the reason people come to you. It is the service you provide, not the level at which you do it.</p>
<p>I thought about why I can&#8217;t leave my current profession and do one of the other 30 things I&#8217;m interested in. My answer: I&#8217;m passionate beyond reason about user experience, revolutionary products, and community dynamics. I would love to execute these things on a mass scale like some of the companies I so admire, but at the moment that would be biting off more than I can chew. I can, however, support the current players involved in these same service pillars and grow from inside the industry. Having said that, I am going to take that approach with MyPossible Inc.&#8217;s first business venture, &#8220;Remarkable Wit&#8221; (RW).</p>
<p>Remarkable Wit is a firm dedicated to internet projects ranging from consumer web properties to industrial applications. We serve as silent partners in projects as well as headliners on a few products of our own. As consultants we help customers find the real value in their idea and create a realistic and attainable goal. As contractors we design and develop very powerful, user focused applications for every market that the internet influences. Finally, we keep the loop open between the creators and the consumers to ensure that the product continues to meet the needs of the consumer.</p>
<p>Let me briefly share just a bit on Plan, Build, Share:</p>
<p><strong>Plan</strong> - (experience strategy)<br />
If you want to enjoy outrageous success in business, always consider how the customer feels when engaged with the company. Whether it is through the advertising, the sales process, or the use and support of the product or service. Many companies fail in the most basic categories of adequate support, respectful customer service and appropriate pricing. Those are just the basics of good business, and it&#8217;s a shame that some entrepreneurs can rightfully claim them as a unique characteristic of their company.</p>
<p><em>You simply should not be offering a service that you cannot properly support. You should not sell anything if you don&#8217;t plan on carrying the &#8217;sales charm&#8217; through into customer service. You should definitely not engage in a business where ripping off customers with price gouging is necessary to stay in business. You should provide a great product, great service, great support and price it all appropriately.</em> Experience strategy says that the primary focus is on creating a mind-blowing experience for the customer. This perspective helps you take your vision and scope it properly for maximum effectiveness and minimum risk.</p>
<p><strong>Build</strong> - (product architecture and development)<br />
Most products, especially technology products, are about luxury and quality. Beyond food, clothing and shelter, people really don&#8217;t *need* anything you are selling. However, people want lots of things that they don&#8217;t need. Therefore, the successful product must meet a strong want of a well defined market. <em>That product should also be crafted to the highest quality that you can reasonably provide. There is no longevity in a product with crappy quality.</em> Product architecture ensures that someone vision actually resembles the picture that they have in their head, rather than becoming a nightmare.</p>
<p>After architecture, personnel, workflow and interaction are  key. You must have the best people doing the best work in the most efficient way in constant communication to avoid getting confused. Creating this environment as well as succeeding are very difficult tasks, but they are tasks that I am quite obsessed with and look forward to completing with RW.</p>
<p><strong>Share</strong> - (community farming)<br />
Today&#8217;s successful company is thinking less about making a profit from their customers, and more about building a long term relationship with their customer that has continued benefits for both parties. Successful communities are the result of a fine tuned ear. You have to listen well, read trends and predict the wants of well defined groups of people. Growing a strong community is much more about listening and implementing than it is about leading. In short, growing a community is about constantly serving the community. Community farming is a philosophy that we put in action through constantly evolving methods of communication between creators and consumers. <em>The goal is that these roles switch between customer and company often throughout the life of the relationship.</em></p>
<p>Creating the forum and being it&#8217;s caretaker is the work of the community farmer. Communities are always looking to be grown, but they need the fertile soil and nourishment to grow. This is an area that I have succeeded in several times over the last few years, and I look forward to growing more communities through RW.</p>
<p>That in a nutshell is what I will be doing. Of course, this is very conceptual and even slightly abstract. This is just done for those who have been interested in what I&#8217;m doing and might stumble upon this post.<!--7a81a318ebda825526d1f1d1641c3853-->

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jessica and our friend Marc had meditation and yoga practice in our mini studio this morning. It was the third day in a row that Jessica and I have gotten up around 6AM and meditated for 15 minutes and then done some yoga. This morning, I made friends with my body&#8217;s resistance and had huge breakthroughs in both meditation and yoga. I just thought I&#8217;d share some, because I feel incredibly empowered by today&#8217;s lesson.<br />
This morning I remembered that a goal which in the present seems near impossible, becomes very possible with constant focus and practice towards achieving it. Early frustration, lack of patience and self doubt are the pillars of limitation. To pass through the limitations and achieve your desires, one only needs to focus on the benefit being received during the journey. In every moment you have the power to melt away the frustration, realize ongoing instant gratification and find countless reasons to love yourself. Today, I&#8217;m one practice closer to realizing a full lotus, and I don&#8217;t care how many more practices I have to do, I really enjoyed getting closer today.<!--da4b714b328927f697f1b5ad5e65d224-->

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When <a href="http://davemadethis.com">Dave</a> and I set out to start <a href="http://barcampnashville.com">BarCamp Nashville</a>, I was completely skeptical about the type of support we would receive. I thought we would need to bring in big name speakers from around the country to generate a decent turn out. Instead, I found tech entrepreneurs, developers, designers, podcasters, musicians, bloggers and just regular people are pumped as hell to get together and geek out. It&#8217;s a pretty interesting phenomena how the digerati circle has expanded through MySpace, Facebook and LinkedIn. Can&#8217;t wait to announce our speakers on July 31st.<!--cf91694aa02392ed688af65ebb2b46da-->

<p>I was trying to do some housecleaning today, both literal and digital. Been uploading some old pics to Flickr, and I came across this pic from our Toronto trip in 2004. We met these boys in the hallway in a hotel, I think a Sheraton, and ended up hanging with them all night.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t even remember their names, but isn&#8217;t it interesting how people you&#8217;ve met once can hold such a special place in your heart. I think one of them was named Gunthar&#8230; or something. One was a CS whiz, one was a military boy, and I don&#8217;t remember about the rest. They were cool as hell though. Anyway, just missing Toronto today, hoping <a href="http://www.davemadethis.com">Dave</a> will get me back there one day <img src='http://www.marcuswhitney.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> <!--9761ae91cab9c56145e6d851a70b203e-->

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes an idea just unfolds before you. My spiritual adviser <a title="Dr. Mitch's Message" href="http://www.rsn.org/Dr_Mitchs_Message/">Dr. Mitch Johnson</a> refers to it as a &#8220;noble purpose.&#8221; Something you are here to do, that makes you feel a satisfaction that is hard to rival with other activities in your life. Last night, I sat down and watched to the new 50 Cent video &#8220;<a title="Straight To The Bank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-cLsNrL6W8">Straight To The Bank</a>&#8220;, and finally wrote a song.Â  I&#8217;m really happy with the song.Â  It has no cursing, a hip yet positive message, and it&#8217;s just some of my better work. I then proceeded to write another complete song to &#8220;<a title="Hustler's Ambition" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzqC15gDk_Q">Hustler&#8217;s Ambition</a>.&#8221; I&#8217;m not sure if I like that song as much, but its definitely also a keeper.</p>
<p>I then went to sleep watching &#8220;Get Rich Or Die Tryin&#8217;&#8221;, 50 Cent&#8217;s somewhat autobiographical movie. What I got from it was a reminder of how dismal the situation in the &#8216;hood&#8217; can be, and why something needs to be done about it. The movie also had a very clear message: regardless of what you think about hip-hop music, for many children of the ghetto, hip-hop <em>seems</em> to be the only way out. This means that hip-hop is a &#8216;language&#8217; they are listening to, and the beats are extremely important.</p>
<p>All this got me thinking, would it not be possible to create an entire education and economic system based on hip-hop?Â  I&#8217;m not talking about the usual &#8220;revolutionary&#8221; hip-hop that does nothing but rant about injustice, but offers no solution.Â  I&#8217;m talking about a system that enlightens the children to true hiphop culture, economics, health, wellness, and self-awareness.<br />
Indeed this is a subset of the mission of the <a title="Temple of HipHop" href="http://templeofhiphop.org">Temple of HipHop</a>. I enquired this morning on how to become a member. When I arrived at the website, I was surprised to see that this week is <a title="HHAW 2007" href="http://templeofhiphop.org/index.php?option=com_content&#038;task=view&#038;id=74&#038;Itemid=1">Hip Hop Appreciation Week</a>. I think I&#8217;m getting signals on my noble purpose.<!--93eea1a4ac18cfc6f9c89f1314172c6a-->

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I was in High School, I wrestled at 181 and Heavyweight.Â  But I could always wrestle at 181 without an issue.Â  I think I now weigh somewhere around 208.Â  I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;m at least 20 pounds overweight, even though most people wouldn&#8217;t think so.Â  I guess my big question is, could I safely drop back down to 181 to compete.Â  I&#8217;m working on setting some actual competition goals for Brazillian Ju-Jitsu.Â  I want to get a fitness and nutrition discipline that will take me back to my proper weight.Â  I&#8217;m just wondering if 181 is actually still a healthy weight for me right now.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="Midnight Blue" href="http://www.midnightbeep.com/">Midnight Blue&#8217;s Inbox</a> doesn&#8217;t even stay open long enough for me to create a task.  It crashes non stop for any action.  But, it does remind me that I am using a trial version and that I REALLY should go ahead and buy a license.  This product is dead in the water.  So, I reverted to <a title="Kinkless" href="http://www.kinkless.com/">Kinkless</a>, and I actually like it a great deal.  Especially since I love outliners,and it&#8217;s just some AppleScripts that add onto <a title="OmniOutliner" href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnioutliner/">Omni Outliner Pro</a>.  I&#8217;ve been looking at <a title="OmniPlan" href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omniplan/">OmniPlan</a> recently as well, just as a compliment to Kinkless for my management of projects beyond the resource of me.  I really hope <a title="OmniFocus" href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnifocus/">OmniFocus</a> turns out well.<br />
I&#8217;m realizing more time is passing since the last time I&#8217;ve written production code, and I am spending a ton of time focused on project, action and productivity management.  Things change.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After my <a title="Marcus on Organization and Simplification" href="http://www.marcuswhitney.com/2007/04/06/strong-urge-to-organize-and-simplify/">first post</a> on trying to get more organized and have things simplified, I got some input from <a title="Dave Delaney" href="http://davemadethis.com">Dave Delaney</a>, which was helpful.  I did begin to use Gmail to sync my iCal and that did help my wife stay more in touch with what I was doing.  However it didn&#8217;t help much with my own simplification.  I am more and more interested in managing my life in project form, so things at work and home have a very similar process and I don&#8217;t lose traction switching gears.  I started on a hunt for tools and after some searching came across <a title="Daylite" href="http://www.marketcircle.com/daylite/">DayLite</a> by seeing MarketCircle on an email from Apple on WWDC.</p>
<p><a id="more-141"></a></p>
<p>Daylite was pretty nice in terms of it&#8217;s approach to project management, however it seems to have ran out of gas on Sync Services integration.  I don&#8217;t want to spend time exporting and importing between applications, that adds work and annoys the crap out of me.  Plus, they kind of wanted you to use them as a replacement for iCal.  Can&#8217;t do that.  iCal is too slick.</p>
<p>So, I went back on the hunt, originally  to find a third party Daylite sync.  In all that searching, and disappointment, I found a link to <a title="Merlin Mann" href="http://www.merlinmann.com/">Merlin Mann&#8217;s</a> website, <a title="43 Folders" href="http://www.43folders.com/">43 Folders</a>.  He was referring to a project called <a title="Kinkless" href="http://www.kinkless.com/">Kinkless GTD</a>.  That started a whole two hour interweb black hole where I learned about Kinkless GTD, bought OmniOutliner Pro just so I could install the free AppleScripts and then realized I had no idea what I was doing.  What the hell was GTD?  In fact, who the hell is this Merlin Mann guy who is talking so much about GTD.  Many of you probably already know about <a title="David Allen" href="http://www.davidco.com">David Allen</a> and his &#8220;<a title="GTD at Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">Getting Things Done</a>&#8221; methodology.  Pretty amazing stuff.  (Sidenote: I didn&#8217;t realize my online friend <a title="Robert Peake" href="http://www.robertpeake.com/">Robert Peake</a> worked for David Allen, or rather I didn&#8217;t know David Allen was quite as important until now)</p>
<p>If you dont know anything about it, I would suggest starting with the Wikipedia entry and maybe spring for the book before digging too deep at 43Folders.com.  The core methodology is promoted by many people with slight slants on it, especially concerning computers.  The book is non tech, and really practical for anyone looking to get a better handle on their workload, goals and life in general.</p>
<p>Anyway, long story short, I&#8217;ve tried three or four apps so far and I think I&#8217;m going with <a title="Inbox" href="http://www.midnightbeep.com/">Midnight Beep&#8217;s Inbox</a>.  Hat tip to <a title="Alex Ezell" href="http://blog.alexezell.com/">Alex</a> for the heads up here.  The thing is, Inbox doesn&#8217;t let me skip steps.  It feels incredibly wrong to use this application without having done an initial collection of issues, data etc.   That&#8217;s what I want.  I want to grind through the initial phase, and breeze through the rest of my life once things are in a manageable state.  At any rate, it&#8217;s forcing me to think about what actually goes in iCal as a todo now.  Since I will be managing all projects in well defined actions, it will be a clusterfark to try and keep 100+ todos in iCal.  So, iCal may start just storing my errands as todos.  Seems more appropriate anyway.</p>
<p>So, now I&#8217;m going to give GTD a shot for a month and I&#8217;ll let you know how it goes.  Along with updates when I hit snags, which I&#8217;m sure I will.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>And I don&#8217;t give a crap if you disagree.  The <a title="Idol Gives Back" href="http://myspace.com/idolgivesback">Idol Gives Back</a> special tonight was amazing.  Sometimes the only thing I know to say is &#8220;God Bless Us All&#8221;.  I&#8217;m not a religious person, but my upbringing (which was in the church) brings me to the feeling that there has to be something that links us all and makes us feel so deeply when we are presented with human suffering.  Yes, some are more attuned to the constant need to give of themselves and help those less fortunate&#8230; but anytime that I can connect with that place of empathy, sympathy and unconditional love I consider myself blessed and driven to act.  I can only hope that it happens more tomorrow than it did today.</p>
<p>The state of malaria in Africa and the poverty right here in America is a greater tragedy than the War in Iraq&#8230; if we must compare.  Honestly, I think it really doesn&#8217;t make a difference.  The killing in Blacksburg and the lack of aid for children around the world is all the same.  A call for us to give more of ourselves.<br />
The beauty of suffering is that it presents an opportunity to receive or give love.</p>
<p>I gave $200 tonight.  It&#8217;s not much, but I sure as hell feel better.  And I hope that action can save a life.

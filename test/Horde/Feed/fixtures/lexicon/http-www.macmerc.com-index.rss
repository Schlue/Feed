<title>Portrait Professional 8 makes you look like a cover model</title>
<link>http://www.macmerc.com/news/archives/4557</link>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.macmerc.com/images/news/PortraitProfessional-20080717-194428.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today Anthropics Technology released &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.portraitprofessional.com/&quot;&gt;Portrait Professional 8&lt;/a&gt;, their intelligent portrait airbrushing software that has been 'trained' in human beauty. I've been playing with Portrait Professional for a few days now, and I have to say, it is amazing. It lets you improve your photos by first telling the software where a few key facial features are located and then it's just a matter of moving a few sliders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portrait Professional requires practically now artistic ability to use nor does it require Photoshop skills. All you have to do is choose how much to enhance the lighting, the skin texture and even how many wrinkles to remove. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macmerc.com/article.php?sid=4557&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;I pointed Portrait Professional at a few of the online elite and the results are shown after the &quot;read more.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The examples shown have been &quot;extremely altered&quot; to show the big adjustments that can be made quickly and easily with the application. Normally, I wouldn't have altered any of these images as much as I have?if at all. To see some subtle and believable ways the software can be used, check out the developer's website or download the demo and try it for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portrait Professional is currently selling at half price--Just USD$79.95&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.macmerc.com/images/reviews/vent_mount3.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The iPod has made itself at home in your car, though that home may not be a comfortable one. I shudder to think of the iPods and iPhones tossed daily onto seats, cup holders and whatever you call that space under the emergency brake handle.
&lt;p&gt;
Treat your iPod to a position of honor in your car and keep your eyes and music off the floorboard with DLO's VentMount. Is this the carseat for your iPhone or iPod touch? Find out in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macmerc.com/reviews.php?op=showcontent&amp;id=173&quot;&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;There is also a free demo feed available so the service can be tried out with no obligations. The free feed contains a few sample ringtones as well as an introduction video and a PDF guide to managing ringtones via iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Typinator 3.1 now with built-in HTML snippets</title>
<link>http://www.macmerc.com/news/archives/4553</link>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.macmerc.com/images/news/typinator-screen-20080714-082214.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Ergonis Software has announced the release of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ergonis.com/products/typinator/&quot;&gt;Typinator 3.1&lt;/a&gt;, the latest version of its auto-typing text application. Typinator detects specific sequences of typed characters and automatically replaces them with text snippets, graphics, URLs, dates and special characters saving you a lot of time, not only typing, but looking up information.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The new version brings along a set of HTML snippets that includes over 100 abbreviations for elements of the HTML 4.01 standard. Typinator 3.1 also improves compatibility with applications such as Coda, VMWare Fusion, Butler, and Zend Studio. 3.1 also has a redesigned (and optional) menu bar icon to better match the style of Apple's menu extras.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The upgrade to Typinator 3.1 is free for anyone who purchased Typinator in the last 2 years. Typinator sells for EUR 19.99 and is also available in family packs.

<title>Save Gas and Work from Home, Part 1</title>
<link>http://www.macmerc.com/news/archives/4551</link>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.macmerc.com/images/news/freeloader-20070913-212511.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Among all the methods out there to save gas, one is sure to actually
help - staying home. You'd think with the tremendous technology and
networks we have that location shouldn't mean much, right?
&lt;p&gt;
I agree, and in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macmerc.com/articles/Freeloader_Friday_Download_of_the_Week/452&quot;&gt;this Freeloader episode&lt;/a&gt; we'll look at a handful of
free applications that will help you justify your work-at-home
strategy. In Part 1 we'll cover the poor corporate saps that work on
or with Windows machines.
&lt;p&gt;
If that's not you, be grateful and hang in there for Part 2 that will
address Mac-only workplaces. If it is you, then &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macmerc.com/articles/Freeloader_Friday_Download_of_the_Week/452&quot;&gt;pull up a chair&lt;/a&gt;. You
may be surprised by what you can do from home on a Mac in the world of
Windows.

<title>1Password intros instant logins from in-browser bookmark window</title>
<link>http://www.macmerc.com/news/archives/4550</link>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.macmerc.com/images/news/1pass-20080708-194902.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, I've asked this before, but it's important enough to ask again: are you still using a few easy-to-remember words and numbers as your personal cache of internet passwords? If this is the case, please consider spending USD$34.95 and getting a copy of &lt;a href=&quot;http://1password.com/&quot;&gt;1Password&lt;/a&gt;. It's exactly what you need: it allows you to have strong passwords for all your online accounts while requiring you to only remember a simple password (your &quot;1 Password&quot;) to get at them. And this works with most popular web browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agile Web Solutions, the makers of 1Password, today announced the release of version 2.7, which introduces a  new feature that allows you to instantly log in to your accounts on your favorite web sites. With one key combination or mouse click you can navigate to a web site, fill in the login details, and submit the form. This is accomplished using a new Bookmarks window that 1Password adds to the web browser, providing easy access to all your passwords. This update is free to all paid 1Password customers.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.macmerc.com/images/news/Drobo_Front_Med-20080708-192726.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today Data Robotics launched &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.drobo.com/Products/Drobo.html&quot;&gt;the second generation of its Drobo &quot;storage robot&quot;&lt;/a&gt;.

<title>Chris Alvanas shows how to retouch eyes in Photoshop</title>
<link>http://www.macmerc.com/news/archives/4547</link>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.macmerc.com/images/news/Adobe_Photoshop_Tutorial_%7C_Digital_Photo_Retouching_%7C_How_to_Brighten_Eyes_in_a_Portrait_%7C_Layers_Magazine-20080706-100541.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Layers Magazine's Chris Alvanas has posted a new tutorial on the site entitled &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.layersmagazine.com/retouching-eyes-in-photoshop.html&quot;&gt;Retouching Eyes in Photoshop&lt;/a&gt;. Because well-done photo retouching is imperceptible, you may not realize all the work that can go into tweaking and perfecting the details of an image. If the eyes are the window to the soul, it would behoove us to properly clean and dress those windows if our images are going to convey the soul we desire.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

<title>The Apple Design Award winners at Iconfactory show you how to make your own</title>
<link>http://www.macmerc.com/news/archives/4546</link>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.macmerc.com/images/news/DIYADA-20080701-222022.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Have you always wanted to win an Apple Design Award? The cool little illuminated cube is something I've coveted for a while now, but since I don't actually produce any hardware or software for any Apple products, I think my chances of winning one are pretty lousy.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://iconfactory.com&quot;&gt;The Iconfactory's&lt;/a&gt; Craig Hockenberry was &lt;a href=&quot;http://iconfactory.com/home/permalink/2006&quot;&gt;awarded an Apple Design Award at WWDC 2008 for Twitterrific for the iPhone&lt;/a&gt;. The award has travelled to North Carolina where the rest of the Iconfactory gang could enjoy it before it went back to Craig's house in Laguna Beach.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The factory workers in NC grew so attached to the award that they decided to create a doppleganger out of a square glass, some clay, some touch lights and, the handyman's secret weapon...duct tape. Throw in some spray paint and some nice penmanship and you have a do-it-yourself Apple Design Award that probably fooled Craig for 10 seconds &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/chockenberry/statuses/847757100&quot;&gt;but put a smile on his face.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The building process has been documented on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/iconfactory/sets/72157605928621268/&quot;&gt;an Iconfactory Flickr set&lt;/a&gt; so that maybe you can pretend to be a ADA winner.

<title>Blambots FREE font for July goes crazy with the autoligatures</title>
<link>http://www.macmerc.com/news/archives/4545</link>

It's got sharp, irregular serifs and varied letter heights to give it a manic, unstable look.  Designed as a perfect logo and title font, the OpenType version is equipped with autoligatures to give your type a random element  and so that no two consecutive letters look the same.

<title>...and yet one more update from Apple. Time Capsule and AirPort Base Station (802.11n) Firmware 7.3.2</title>
<link>http://www.macmerc.com/news/archives/4544</link>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.macmerc.com/images/news/timecapsule-20080630-213551.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I must admit, I have an irrational fear of firmware updates.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/timecapsuleandairportbasestation80211nfirmware732.html&quot;&gt;Time Capsule and AirPort Base Station (802.11n) Firmware 7.3.2&lt;/a&gt; update requires that you already have AirPort Utility 5.3.2 installed (versions for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/airportutility532forleopard.html&quot;&gt;Leopard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/airportutility532tiger.html&quot;&gt;Tiger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/airportutilitysetup532forwindows.html&quot;&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt; are available).
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
What does it do? Well, let's see what Apple has to say...
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Time Capsule, AirPort Extreme and AirPort Express Base Station with 802.11n* Firmware 7.3.2 updates include bug fixes.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Hmm...bug fixes. That should take care of anyone who found &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macmerc.com/news/apple/4542&quot;&gt;the write ups on the other updates too exhaustive&lt;/a&gt; but it doesn't ease my fears.

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.macmerc.com/images/news/safari-20080318-200824.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Apple doesn't want Tiger users to feel left out of the day's updating fun. They've released a special &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/safari312fortiger.html&quot;&gt;Safari 3.1.2 for Tiger&lt;/a&gt; update.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It's sole &lt;a href=&quot;http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2165&quot;&gt;purpose&lt;/a&gt; appears to be a WebKit update that prevents an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution while visiting a maliciously crafted website.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Whew! That's a relief!
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Now Mac OS X 10.4.11 users can visit all their favorite maliciously crafted websites again!

&lt;/ul&gt;
Publishing pros will be happy to know that the 10.5.4 update includes fixes that help it play nicely with Adobe Creative Suite apps like InDesign and Photoshop.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;Apple's 10.5.4 update contains more fixes for the Nav Services crash problem that manifests itself most frequently in InDesign. It also contains a fix for the file corruption problem that occurs when saving files to a remote server.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

<title>In honor of today's Twitter outage we are proud to announce the Fail Whale T-shirt</title>
<link>http://www.macmerc.com/news/archives/4541</link>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;s&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.macmerc.com/images/news/image.php-20080627-095000.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;s&gt;Feeling overloaded? Need a lift? Twitter certainly does...
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
...and now you can sport that same overloaded look with our new Fail Whale T-Shirt. This men's soft cotton jersey tee (by American Apparel) comes is traditional Twitter turquoise and displays an interpretation of Yiying Lu's wonderful illustration that has been made infamous on one of Twitter's error pages. 
&lt;/s&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;s&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2173/2540050488_e8792bec32.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;s&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  The shirt comes in sizes ranging from Small to XX-Large and sells for USD$25.40
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  Be sure to check out this and all our other shirts in The MacMerc Store.
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;UPDATE&lt;/b&gt; (06/27/08 - 12:31 PT): It has been brought to my attention that I neglected to make the Fail Whale shirt available in a women's cut. This has been remedied, but unfortunately not in teal. If you would like to construct your own Fail Whale apparel, you may do so here.&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;UPDATE&lt;/b&gt; (06/27/08 - 18:52 PT): I have taken down our Fail Whale t-shirts in favor of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zazzle.com/failwhale&quot;&gt;a link to shirts offered by the Fail Whale illustrator, Yiying Lu&lt;/a&gt;. I haven't found that Zazzle shirts are of as high a quality as Spreadshirt (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macmerc.com/articles/The_Lab_with_Leo_Laporte_Segments/435&quot;&gt;see here&lt;/a&gt;), but I would rather an artist profit for his work rather that some smart alec like me. Cheers.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Run Spore Creature Creator Demo on Mac OS X 10.4.11 Tiger</title>
<link>http://www.macmerc.com/news/archives/4539</link>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.macmerc.com/images/news/spore-20080623-210730.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Evidently, the only thing keeping some users of Mac OS X 10.4.11 Tiger from using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spore.com/trial?sourceid=eaom35&quot;&gt;Spore Creature Creator Demo&lt;/a&gt; is that the application is coded to look for and only accept Mac OS X 10.5.3.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
An anonymous user over at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20080622112907382&quot;&gt;Mac OS X Hints&lt;/a&gt; has posted instructions on how to easily alter a plist in the game's package contents to have it check for a slightly older operating system. Voila! Now, as the editor at Mac OS X Hints notes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;System requirements are typically based on features in a given level of the OS, so there may be unknown issues if you use this hint to run the demo on an earlier version of the OS. Maybe this will work for the full version too...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

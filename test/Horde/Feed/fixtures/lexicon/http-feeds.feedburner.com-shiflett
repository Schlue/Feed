            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I haven't been blogging much lately, and for the first time since I <a href="http://shiflett.org/blog/2003/aug/a-new-beginning">started this blog</a>, I've only managed one post all month.</p>
<p>There has been plenty to talk about, but I've been too busy with both <a href="http://omniti.com/">work</a> and <a href="http://euro2008.uefa.com/">play</a> to keep up. I'll try to recap the previous month (roughly in chronological order) for posterity.</p>
<ul>
    <li>I saw <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Hansard">Glen Hansard</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark%C3%A9ta_Irglov%C3%A1">Markéta Irglová</a> at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_City_Music_Hall">Radio City Music Hall</a>, which was possibly the best show I've ever seen. (It's tough to beat the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigo_Girls">Indigo Girls</a>, though.) If you live in NY, and you're not going to <a href="http://zendcon.com/">ZendCon</a>, you can see them in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Park">Central Park</a> in September.</li>
    <li>I went to Chicago for <a href="http://tek.phparch.com/">php|tek</a>, easily one the best PHP conferences each year. I got to celebrate my birthday at <a href="http://shoelessjoesrosemont.com/">Shoeless Joe's</a> while watching the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League">Champions League</a> final, and I ended the day with a brief stint as a rock star.</li>
    <li>My wife and I took a canoe down the Delaware River with some friends, and we camped on a small island. I rediscovered my hatred for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stinging_nettle">stinging nettles</a>.</li> 
    <li>I gave a keynote at the DC PHP Conference on the intersection of security and user experience. As with most new talks, it was unpolished, but I'll be giving an updated, polished version of it at ZendCon. (See you there?)</li>
    <li>I enjoyed the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telectroscope">Telectroscope</a>, despite not managing to convince <a href="http://hackdiary.com/">Matt</a>, <a href="http://lornajane.net/">Lorna</a>, or anyone else to meet up on the London side. Luckily, I managed to convince a few people that it was real, so that was fun. :-) It was conveniently located a few steps away from OmniTI NY, and I took some <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/shiflett/tags/telectroscope/">photos</a> while it was here.</li>
    <li>The Euro Cup started. :-)</li>
    <li>My blog was <a href="http://smashingmagazine.com/2008/06/12/block-quotes-and-pull-quotes-examples-and-good-practices/">featured in Smashing Magazine</a> again, this time for the pretty blockquote and note styles <a href="http://jontangerine.com/">Jon</a> designed.</li>
    <li>Motivated by <a href="http://gravitonic.com/">Andrei</a>, I started the <a href="http://hundredpushups.com/">hundred push-ups challenge</a>. This commitment also persuaded me to check my various style guides to see whether it's pushup, push up, or push-up. :-) News spread quickly on Twitter, and there is now a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=22497498244">group of PHPers</a> all taking part in the challenge.</li>
    <li><a href="http://omniti.com/is/theo-schlossnagle">Theo</a> was <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2008/06/the-new-internet-traffic-spike.html">mentioned on Radar again</a> for his detailed post on <a href="http://lethargy.org/~jesus/archives/118-Dissecting-todays-Internet-traffic-spikes.html">Internet traffic spikes</a>.</li>
    <li>I got to witness a colleague's first encounter with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paamayim_Nekudotayim"><code>T_PAAMAYIM_NEKUDOTAYIM</code></a>, which I enjoyed far too much.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll leave you with the <a href="http://twitter.com/rasmus/statuses/846657905">PHP anthem from Rasmus</a>. If you're a Mac user, just enter the following in the terminal:</p>
<pre class="code">
<code>say -v Good oh PHP ow ow oh PHP ow oh PHP ow ow oh PHP ow oh PHP ow ow oh PHP ow oh PHP ow ow oh PHP ouchie</code>
</pre>
<p>If you're not a Mac user, <a href="http://terrychay.com/m/au/phpAnthem.mp3">Terry has an MP3</a>.</p>
<p>Sing it with me...</p> <p style="margin: 0px; padding: 5px 15px 5px 15px; background: #f1f3fc; border: 1px solid #656F72; color: #656F72">

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This past week, I noticed several feeds I poll for <a href="http://shiflett.org/planet">Planet Chris</a> are broken. In a few cases, it's because the site is offline. In most cases, it's because people don't maintain URLs when they change <a href="http://naramore.net/blog/">blog</a> <a href="http://mtabini.blogspot.com/">engines</a>. (Hint!)</p>
<div class="note"><p>I've been thinking about changing my feed URLs as well, because <em>/feed</em> doesn't let me gracefully offer more than one. (<a href="http://shiflett.org/blog/2007/jan/url-vanity">URL vanity</a> strikes again.) I'll be sure to maintain the old ones, though.</p></div>
<p>Questioning the completeness of my own planet's coverage, I visited <a href="http://planet-php.org/">Planet PHP</a> for the first time in a while, and <a href="http://hasin.wordpress.com/">Hasin Hayder</a>'s post <em><a href="http://hasin.wordpress.com/2008/05/12/i-dont-give-you-a-damn-if/">I don't give you a damn, if</a></em> caught my eye. Not wanting to be denied a damn, I read the post to learn more. The title completes:</p>
<blockquote><p>You came to an interview for PHP Developer and you said you don't know the name Rasmus Lerdorf.</p></blockquote>
<p>He poses an interesting question. How well should someone know a particular technology's history, community, or culture to be considered adequately proficient?</p>
<p>It's easy to draw parallels between this and other debates surrounding indicators of proficiency, such as the <a href="http://zend.com/en/services/certification/">Zend certification</a>. A common <a href="http://shiflett.org/blog/2007/sep/logic">straw man</a> is to say the indicator alone proves nothing. In this particular case, Hasin's initial comments are strong enough that this argument is understandable, but he later <a href="http://hasin.wordpress.com/2008/05/12/i-dont-give-you-a-damn-if/#comment-65508">clarifies</a>. Another illogical argument is that we can't possibly know the creator of everything we use. (Examples include the internal combustion engine, the toaster, fire, and the wheel.) Hasin's comments aren't directed at those who use PHP tangentially; he is seeking those for whom PHP is a core competency.</p>
<p>Personally, I look for people who are passionate about what they do, because I want to surround myself with others who enjoy coming to <a href="http://omniti.com/">work</a> as much as I do. Knowing Rasmus created PHP doesn't prove passion, but it does make sense to use this as an indicator. I have never asked this question in an interview and probably never will, but I suspect everyone I have hired knows the answer. The real question is whether it's valuable enough to justify asking in an interview. I'm pretty sure there are better questions.</p>
<p>Aside from standard technical questions, what do you do to evaluate candidates? Is there anything you've found to be especially helpful?</p><p style="margin: 0px; padding: 5px 15px 5px 15px; background: #f1f3fc; border: 1px solid #656F72; color: #656F72">

				<title>Das Keyboard? Nein!</title>
				<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/2008/07/04/das-keyboard-nein</guid>
				<link>http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/2008/07/04/das-keyboard-nein</link>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Vanity comes in all shapes. &lt;a href=&#034;http://daskeyboard.com/&#034;&gt;Das Keyboard&lt;/a&gt; is one of them. I still enjoy old IBM keyboards at home (too noisy for work) but PS2-to-USB adapter I am using to hook it up to my Mac frequently causes glitches so Das Keyboard looked like a potential replacement. But after going through the spec and reviews, it was clearly not.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Clicky-clack noise is not why I use old IBM keyboards. Feel of buckling-spring keyboard is. I have yet to find any mechanism that could replicate that feel without actually using springs that buckle under pressure (behavior of buckling spring is &lt;a href=&#034;http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=catastrophe+theory+buckling+spring&#034;&gt;complex&lt;/a&gt; to say the least). With buckling-spring, you type WITH the keyboard. Without, you type ON the keyboard. It&#039;s the same difference as dancing with a lively partner versus a bad one. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Das Keyboard doesn&#039;t use buckling-spring (puzzling since IBM&#039;s patent expired). It uses mechanical switches (close but not enough). That&#039;s the end of story. And, no, there is nothing &lt;a href=&#034;http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,2845,2324503,00.asp&#034;&gt;proud about being loud&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Increasing Polarity in News</title>
				<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/2008/07/03/increasing-polarity-in-news</guid>
				<link>http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/2008/07/03/increasing-polarity-in-news</link>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I made this comment elsewhere on the Net, posted here because I don&#039;t blog often enough these days: &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am concerned more about increasing polarity among news media in middle-tier countries like South Korea, liberals and conservatives subscribing only to news mediums that reflect their biases, news mediums fueling biases of their subscribers for monetary or idealistic profit. It&#039;s quite an ugly loop of bias that leaves little room for discussion and facts, leaving only room for debates and rumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve had this view for quite a while now but stating it now because the trend is picking up speed thanks to Internet. What this trend leads to is a vacuum of active moderates, leaving only passive middle in the political spectrum. As polarity grows, each side finds it increasingly difficult to understand the views of the other side, pushing past the point of absurdity and moving toward the point of dehumanization and beyond: violence in the name of patriotic duty. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Slow Firework II</title>
				<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/2008/05/20/slow-firework-ii</guid>
				<link>http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/2008/05/20/slow-firework-ii</link>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Watching &lt;a href=&#034;http://joi.ito.com/weblog/2008/05/20/video-of-cookin.html&#034;&gt;Joi&#039;s video of bamboos in his backyard&lt;/a&gt; reminded me that I neglected to blog about our cactus which started it&#039;s second &lt;em&gt;firework&lt;/em&gt; a month ago. It sort of looks like bamboo but no bamboo shoots. I hope it blooms soon because it&#039;s getting too tall.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p align=&#034;center&#034;&gt;&lt;a href=&#034;http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/files/notbamboo_2.jpg&#034;&gt;&lt;img style=&#034;border: 0px none &#034; src=&#034;http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/files/notbamboo_thumb.jpg&#034; border=&#034;0&#034; alt=&#034;notbamboo&#034; width=&#034;360&#034; height=&#034;480&#034;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Above picture was taken from my home office with my iPhone (no Leica like Joi and too lazy to climb out of my coding hole). Cactus on the left is what remained from the &lt;a href=&#034;http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/2005/03/20/blooming-cactus&#034;&gt;first slow mothion firework&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of bamboos, we had bamboos too but it started to spread out of control so we had to get rid of them (tried everything but finally had to get rid of the wooden deck and pave over them with concrete). I still occasionally get nightmares of bamboo breaking out of concrete. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>SwitchABit - Server-side Appily?</title>
				<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/2008/05/17/switchabit---server-side-appily</guid>
				<link>http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/2008/05/17/switchabit---server-side-appily</link>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I haven&#039;t got around to read about Dave&#039;s &lt;a href=&#034;http://www.scripting.com/stories/2008/05/15/switchingToSwitchabit.html&#034;&gt;SwitchABit&lt;/a&gt; until now but it sounds a lot like what I had in mind with &lt;a href=&#034;http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/search?q=appily&#034;&gt;Appily&lt;/a&gt; except, where Appily&#039;s approach is client-side, SwitchABit is server-side. Or is it client-side too, like Radio was? Either way, I think Dave is on the ball: personal service combinator. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As a business, I think server-side is better but that&#039;s seemed less exciting than client-side to me when I was sketching out Appily. I wish I had more time for Appily. What am I doing now? Working my butt off to launch something exciting in the security space.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>XP SP3 Suckage</title>
				<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/2008/05/15/xp-sp3-suckage</guid>
				<link>http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/2008/05/15/xp-sp3-suckage</link>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;XP SP3 update appears to be running just fine in relatively fresh (5 months) installation of XP running on my laptop&#039;s VMware Fusion but not on my PC with 2 year old XP installation. Most annoying symtom is IE7 hanging more than 10 times a day on arbitrary pages. I tried several supposed fixes but to none are working. I&#039;ve been suspecting that many security vulnerability patches from Microsoft resorted to adding extra synchronization blocks resulting in more frequent pauses and, now, it looks like they&#039;ve finally gone overboard, leaving IE useless. Uninstalling SP3 until coast is clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Firefox side, I had to abandon Firefox 3.0B5 in favor of a nightly build (ironically named Minefield despite being more stable than B5) because it was crashing too often.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Granting H-1B by Public Review</title>
				<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/2008/05/07/granting-h-1b-by-public-review</guid>
				<link>http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/2008/05/07/granting-h-1b-by-public-review</link>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I think granting H-1B visa by public review might be more effective than the way it&#039;s done now. The idea is to let any U.S. citizen participate in to the selection process. One way to do that is, with H-1B application and applicant submitted resume available online, give N opinion points for each volunteer to express positive or negative opinion on N applicants. Authentication can be done with the same way electronic tax filing is done.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;There is lots of room for abuse but, conceptually, I like this idea.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Another Birthday</title>
				<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/2008/05/03/another-birthday</guid>
				<link>http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/2008/05/03/another-birthday</link>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;What follows Tax Day in my brain? My birthday. Yup, I took another step toward 50 today, leaving just four more steps left. Oy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t like birthdays but I had to give in when my son let me know I was robbing him the pleasure of buying his dad a birthday present. So I let him get me Grand Theft Auto IV. Nice, particularly because I tend to spend most of my time looking at places when I play games. I haven&#039;t had the time to play the game yet but I am hoping Liberty City is as well implemented as the cities and valleys in Assassin&#039;s Greed where I&#039;ve been spending an hour every other day just running around or climbing to catch virtual sunsets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It would be cool to play full online world version of GTA. Maybe with stock market as well as fences to sell stolen goods. And it would be cool to have top 1000 bloggers in the game as roadkills, er, residents.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Mad Cow Disease Hysteria in Korea</title>
				<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/2008/05/02/mad-cow-disease-hysteria-in-korea</guid>
				<link>http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/2008/05/02/mad-cow-disease-hysteria-in-korea</link>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Hysteria over mad cow disease is reaching boiling point in South Korea (&lt;a href=&#034;http://kr.news.yahoo.com/service/news/shellview.htm?linkid=12&amp;amp;articleid=2008050220090982523&amp;amp;newssetid=82&#034;&gt;photos of candle vigil&lt;/a&gt;), triggered by recent pre-FTA concession by South Korean President Lee to remove ban against US beef and boosted by a timely sensational episode on PD Notebook, a Korean version of 60-minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
             &lt;p&gt;Regardless of all the arguments for or against US beef export to Korea, I find it interesting that people are desensitized to countless deaths-by-car yet hysterical over the possibility of death-by-food. And it&#039;s ironic that Korean automakers stand to gain significantly from the US-Korea FTA if it goes through.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Java 6 on Leopard</title>
				<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/2008/05/01/java-6-on-leopard</guid>
				<link>http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/2008/05/01/java-6-on-leopard</link>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Java 6 is now available for Leopard but it&#039;s 64-bit only and I&#039;ve confirmed that Eclipse 3.3 won&#039;t run using it. So it&#039;s appropriate only for running 64-bit ready Java software (like Tomcat) for now.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;If you still want to set it as default VM, first try the Java Preference app in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;/Applications/Utilities/Java &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The app is apparently sensitive to command-level profile changes so it didn&#039;t work for me. What worked for me is the following:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;cd /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;sudo ln -fhsv 1.6 CurrentJDK&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;sudo ln -fhsv 1.6 Current&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To undo above changes, simply repeat the command back to where CurrentJDK and Current symlinks were pointing to. For me, following worked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;sudo ln -fhsv 1.5 CurrentJDK&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;sudo ln -fhsv A Current&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

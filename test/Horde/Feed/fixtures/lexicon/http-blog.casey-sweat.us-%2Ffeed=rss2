		<description><![CDATA[I was recently given the opportunity to review a new book on the subject of PHP and Oracle databases.  We use Oracle databases nearly exclusively at work, so this seemed like a good opportunity to me.
&#8220;PHP Oracle Web Development&#8221; itself resembles many other technical references available for PHP, soft cover, approximately 375 pages, from [...]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Right now I am sitting in the B concourse of Chicago Oâ€™Hare airport. The next two flights to Pittsburg have been canceled, so I am going to be late to my corporate eBusiness summit meeting.


Where I would rather be is with Marco and crew in Toranto at the PHP&#124;Works conference. I am sad to miss the chance to hobnob with my PHP buddies.

Another interesting conference comming up is the DC PHP conference in Oct. It looks like many of the familiar PHP faces will be around there as well.

If you are in the UK, perhaps we can hook up at the October PHP London meeting, I am on a business trip to the UK and was able to schedule it to attend this as well.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Recently, Jani Taskinen publicly decided to disassociate himself from the PHP project. An individual is certainly able to choose how they allocate their time, particularly when it is a volunteer effort, I and respect his decision.  For the past few days I have been mulling over how he came to make that decision though.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If you have never been to a PHP Conference, you owe it to yourself to make 2006 a year to attend one. There are of course the obvious benefits of attending the presentations and being able to see these presentations first hand as well as being able to interact with the presenters, ask questions, etc. A more subtle benefit is the networking which happens at these conferences. People whom you recognize from email addresses on mailing lists, pseudonyms on forums or names on the covers of PHP books are actually living breathing people (and usually fine, upstanding people at that). PHP conferences are a great opportunity to interact with both the presenters, conference organizers and the other attendees, who likely share many common interests with you, chiefly a passion for PHP and web development.]]></description>

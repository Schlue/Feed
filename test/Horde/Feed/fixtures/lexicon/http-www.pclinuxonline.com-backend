		<title>Parsix: Persian distro makes GNOME look good</title>
		<link>http://www.pclinuxonline.com/comment.php?comment.news.395</link>
		<description>Last month the Parsix Linux distribution made its 1.0 release after almost a year of development. Parsix is a GNOME-based distro based on the testing branch of Debian GNU/Linux with elements from Kanotix. It makes an attractive alternative to Ubuntu.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

		<title>DirectX 9.0c on Linux with Wine</title>
		<link>http://www.pclinuxonline.com/comment.php?comment.news.392</link>
		<description>I have posted a howto about installing DirectX 9.0c into Wine, the diagnostics program (dxdiag.exe) passes each of the test that is included in the standard DirectX install.. after the install only five dlls need to be set as builtin Wine dlls and the rest can be run as native Windows dlls. While this is not 100% DirectX on Linux, it is 95+% and that&amp;#039;s about as close as your going to get... as the five dlls that have to be set to builtin need direct access to hardware.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

		<title>New Wine help and discussion forum</title>
		<link>http://www.pclinuxonline.com/comment.php?comment.news.389</link>
		<description>Today the new Wine help and discussion forum at wine-forum.org went live, the forums are meant to be a meeting place for anyone interested in Wine usage or development. In the past there there has never been a single forum dedicated just to Wine. In the past the Wine project has used mailing lists, newsgroups and other methods for user discussion leaving many postings about Wine in other forums where Wine was always relegated as a sub-forum.

We at Wine-Review hope the forum brings Wine users together into a single meeting place where they can discuss anything relevant to the daily happenings </description>

		<title>An open letter to Steve Ballmer from Mandriva</title>
		<link>http://www.pclinuxonline.com/comment.php?comment.news.388</link>
		<description>We recently closed a deal with the Nigerian Government. Maybe you heard about it, Steve. They were looking for an affordable hardware+software solution for their schools. The initial batch was 17,000 machines. We had a good answer to their need: the Classmate PC from Intel, with a customized Mandriva Linux solution. We presented the solution to the local government, they liked the machine, they liked our system, they liked what we offered them, the fact that it was open, that we could customize it for their country and so on.

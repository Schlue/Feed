<title>At the App Store, “the party has just begun”</title>
<link>http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/08_30/b4093000232980.htm?chan=top+news_top+news+index_news+%2B+analysis</link>
<description>It’s the software, maintains BusinessWeek’s Stephen Wildstrom, that “separates the iPhone from the pack.” And, he predicts,  “the App Store will turn that gap into a gulf.” That’s because the iPhone “provides a unique combination of an extremely capable device, millions of customers hungry for ways to expand its usefulness, and an enthusiastic (crazed, one could say) community of developers.”</description>

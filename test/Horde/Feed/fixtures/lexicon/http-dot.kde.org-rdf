           <title>UserBase Goes Live!</title>
           <description>
             The KDE community is pleased to announce &lt;a href=&quot;http://userbase.kde.org&quot;&gt;UserBase&lt;/a&gt;. UserBase is the new end-user wiki for KDE and complements &lt;a href=&quot;http://techbase.kde.org&quot;&gt;TechBase&lt;/a&gt;, the wiki aimed at developers. It will contain tips and tricks, links to where to get more help, as well as an application catalogue giving an overview of the different kinds of programs that KDE offers.



&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;After weeks of preparation and vivid discussions at Akademy, UserBase is ready to help users with their day-to-day problems and is awaiting contributions from the wider community. &lt;a href=&quot;http://userbase.kde.org/Talk:Welcome_to_KDE_UserBase&quot;&gt;A Talk page&lt;/a&gt; is available, for suggestions and requests for content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The KDE community hopes to offer information that is better tailored to the needs of the KDE users by offering them a place to share their knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For questions regarding UserBase please contact the Community Working Group at community-wg@kde.org.&lt;/p&gt;

           <title>KDE Congratulates CERN's Large Hadron Collider</title>
           <description>
             Today was Big Bang Day at CERN as the world's largest science experiment was turned on.  Like all good technology enthusiasts the KDE developers have been keeping up with the progress of the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland.  We are pleased to see that like all &lt;a href=&quot;http://edu.kde.org/step/&quot;&gt;world class physicists&lt;/a&gt;  the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/bigbang/gallery.shtml?select=13&quot;&gt;first ever ATLAS results&lt;/a&gt; come from KDE.  Their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spiegel.de/fotostrecke/fotostrecke-35141-3.html&quot;&gt;impressive control centre&lt;/a&gt; is also &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spiegel.de/fotostrecke/fotostrecke-35141-5.html&quot;&gt;making excellent use of KNotes&lt;/a&gt;.  Just as good, the world has not yet been sucked into a black hole.

           <title>Akademy 2008 was Amazing</title>
           <description>
             It has been a couple of weeks since &lt;a href=&quot;http://akademy2008.kde.org/&quot;&gt;Akademy 2008&lt;/a&gt; finished.  KDE's contributors are now back home, more enthusiastic than ever about our future.  If you missed the talks &lt;a href=&quot;http://akademy2008.kde.org/conference/program.php&quot;&gt;videos are now online&lt;/a&gt;. This article covers what happened during the week and outlines some of the results. Read on for more.



















&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;float: right; border: thin solid grey; padding: 1ex; margin: 1ex; width: 400px&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://static.kdenews.org/jr/akademy-2008-final-article/akademy-2008-location.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.kdenews.org/jr/akademy-2008-final-article/wee-akademy-2008-location.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;267&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is where Akademy was held.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Beginning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Friday August 15th 2008, hundreds of KDE contributors came to the city of Mechelen to register for the event many had been looking forward to for almost a year: &lt;a href=&quot;http://akademy2008.kde.org&quot;&gt;Akademy 2008&lt;/a&gt;. We played. We worked hard. We drank beer and we ate food. We even &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nielsvm.org/2008/08/13/french-fries-size-comparison/&quot;&gt;discussed eating food&lt;/a&gt;. We listened to talks. We brainstormed. We discussed. We designed. And we wrote code. But after a long and busy week, it was time to go home. Most of us have regained our strength after this exhausting, yet energising week, and we are looking back at one of the best meetings we ever had. Of course, one can never really capture all that happened. Despite the impact of the keynotes and BoF's, much happened in the corridors. Much has not been recorded anywhere but in the memories of those participating. The following report therefore focuses on the big events and the announcements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;float: left; border: thin solid grey; padding: 1ex; margin: 1ex; width: 300px&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://static.kdenews.org/jr/akademy-2008-final-article/akademy-2008-enthousiastic.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.kdenews.org/jr/akademy-2008-final-article/wee-akademy-2008-enthousiastic.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Modelling the latest sleek design.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://dot.kde.org/1218353987/&quot;&gt;first day&lt;/a&gt; of Akademy brought us two keynotes, 16 other presentations, and various lightning talks about Plasma, moderated by Aaron Seigo. The first keynote was given by Frank Karlitschek. He spoke about increasing community involvement by giving &quot;power to the people&quot;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.open-collaboration-services.org/&quot;&gt;refreshing ideas in his talk&lt;/a&gt; represented Akademy 2008 in a nutshell: innovation and community. This topic was further explored in talks following the keynote. Some of these ideas are described in the article about &lt;a href=&quot;http://dot.kde.org/1218645101&quot;&gt;integration at Akademy&lt;/a&gt;. Related was the talk about a &lt;a href=&quot;http://dot.kde.org/1219926799/&quot;&gt;future development model of KDE&lt;/a&gt;. This talk and the BoF session later on have resulted in many discussions within the community. Time will tell if the ideas discussed will really shape the future of KDE development and the Free Desktop at large. The second keynote was about Nokia, who discussed their involvement in Qt and KDE. On Tuesday, Nokia gave away over 100 N810 internet devices to KDE developers to prove their point, and we also reported their support for &lt;a href=&quot;http://dot.kde.org/1218543988/&quot;&gt;the Firefox port to Qt&lt;/a&gt; in cooperation with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mozilla.org&quot;&gt;Mozilla&lt;/a&gt;. Suffice to say, the first day at Akademy was a great success.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;More news came in during &lt;a href=&quot;http://dot.kde.org/1218497374&quot;&gt;the second day&lt;/a&gt;, most notable the &lt;a href=&quot;http://dot.kde.org/1218387228/&quot;&gt;the many improvements in Qt 4.5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://dot.kde.org/1218388855/&quot;&gt;work by the KDE-PIM hackers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://dot.kde.org/1220789755/&quot;&gt;JOLIE bringing service-oriented computing to KDE&lt;/a&gt;. Later on, a casual meeting of Frank Karlitschek and Fabrizio resulted in plans for &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.karlitschek.de/2008/08/akademy-rocks.html&quot;&gt;co-operation&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://fmontesi.blogspot.com/2008/08/open-collaboration-services-have-been.html&quot;&gt;between&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.open-collaboration-services.org/&quot;&gt;Open Collaboration project&lt;/a&gt; and JOLIE. A great and certainly not unique example of how Akademy brings people with brilliant ideas together!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;float: right; border: thin solid grey; padding: 1ex; margin: 1ex; width: 300px&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://static.kdenews.org/jr/akademy-2008-final-article/akademy-2008-whos-weird.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.kdenews.org/jr/akademy-2008-final-article/wee-akademy-2008-whos-weird.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We can always depend on Seb to find practical solutions to difficult problems (this cup was meant to hold the voting cards up...)
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day ended by &lt;a href=&quot;http://dot.kde.org/1218497374&quot;&gt;handing out the Akademy Awards&lt;/a&gt;. Mark Kretschmann and the Amarok team, Nuno Pinheiro and the Oxygen team, and Aaron Seigo and the Plasma developers were awarded with the official metal gear and praise and recognition from the community. Of course, we gave a standing ovation to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://commonideas.blogspot.com/2008/08/akademy-2008-team.html&quot;&gt;organisers of this year's Akademy&lt;/a&gt; as well.

&lt;h1&gt;Moving on...&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday was set aside for the famous &lt;a href=&quot;http://ev.kde.org&quot;&gt;KDE e.V.&lt;/a&gt; meeting. 7 hours of talking and (re)counting votes, who could say no to such an experience? Not many - we welcomed several new members to the e.V. and during the meeting, the previous &lt;a href=&quot;http://dot.kde.org/1218451963/&quot;&gt;quarterly report&lt;/a&gt; was released. Further, it was decided to &lt;a href=&quot;http://dot.kde.org/1218525921/&quot;&gt;endorse the new Community Working Group, and a Code of Conduct&lt;/a&gt;. We also voted on and &lt;a href=&quot;http://dot.kde.org/1219405212/&quot;&gt;accepted the Fiduciary License Agreement (FLA)&lt;/a&gt;, which has been worked on for the last year in co-operation with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://fsfe.org/&quot;&gt;Free Software Foundation Europe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;float: left; border: thin solid grey; padding: 1ex; margin: 1ex; width: 400px&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://static.kdenews.org/jr/akademy-2008-final-article/akademy-2008-out-for-beer.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.kdenews.org/jr/akademy-2008-final-article/wee-akademy-2008-out-for-beer.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;267&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Having food and a beer in Mechelen.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exciting atmosphere and the Nokia N810 devices we received fuelled much of the discussion during the Emsys-sponsored &lt;a href=&quot;http://akademy.kde.org/events/emmobile.php#maemo&quot;&gt;Embedded and Mobile day&lt;/a&gt;. Nokia clearly played a vital role, demonstrating their long-term commitment to Qt and KDE. Soon &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fredemmott.co.uk/blog_154&quot;&gt;blog posts&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.forwardbias.in/2008/08/n810-is-awesome.html&quot;&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kdedevelopers.org/node/3628&quot;&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nseries.com/products/n810/&quot;&gt;Nokia N810&lt;/a&gt; showed up with KDE developers talking about the potential of this device. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kdedevelopers.org/node/3624&quot;&gt;KDE packages&lt;/a&gt; for the N810 are already available, and much work is going into porting several key KDE infrastructures like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.notmart.org/index.php/Software/Misc_plasmoids_on_n810&quot;&gt;Plasma&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kdedevelopers.org/node/3623&quot;&gt;Ruby&lt;/a&gt; bindings support to it. Expect more, especially since Nokia &lt;a href=&quot;http://akademy2008.kde.org/events/social_event.php&quot;&gt;provided lots of free food and beer at the social event&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday night!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;float: right; border: thin solid grey; padding: 1ex; margin: 1ex; width: 400px&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://static.kdenews.org/jr/akademy-2008-final-article/akademy-2008-discussing-plasma.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.kdenews.org/jr/akademy-2008-final-article/wee-akademy-2008-discussing-plasma.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;267&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Careful, hot Plasma design going on!
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Development and BOF Meetings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thuesday, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://akademy2008.kde.org/events/bof.php&quot;&gt;BoF sessions&lt;/a&gt; (done &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference&quot;&gt;&quot;unconference&quot;&lt;/a&gt; style) started. The purpose of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_of_a_Feather_(computing)&quot;&gt;BoF&lt;/a&gt; sessions is to bring developers interested in a certain subject together to talk about it informally. During the BoF sessions, several rooms centring around a certain sub-project were available: the Amarok Den, the Plasma Hackers Containment, and the Office and PIM productivity room. In each of these rooms you could find 20-odd developers working on their respective applications, using the whiteboards to develop new interface concepts or discussing the weather (bad). Furthermore, two days were reserved for a more in-depth exploration of important topics: &lt;a href=&quot;http://akademy2008.kde.org/events/bof.php#welcome&quot;&gt;the HCI usability day&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://akademy2008.kde.org/events/bof.php#solarisplatform&quot;&gt;Sun tutorials day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We can not detail everything that happened in these rooms, but here is a quick impression of some of the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;float: left; border: thin solid grey; padding: 1ex; margin: 1ex; width: 400px&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://static.kdenews.org/jr/akademy-2008-final-article/akademy-2008-good-weather.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.kdenews.org/jr/akademy-2008-final-article/wee-akademy-2008-good-weather.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;267&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Outside enjoying the weather.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One interesting discussion in the Plasma Containment room was about small form-factors. Aaron Seigo noted how they figured out how to solve the issue with the system tray taking up too much space - combining it with the notification widget. A big target for the Plasma developers is to ensure Plasma can just as easily be controlled with multiple fingers or thumbs as with the mouse. For this, work on a full-screen application launcher and better controls is being undertaken. Another interesting development is going on around a Qt port of Edje. Edje allows a separation between the application logic and the user interface, which is described in an easy-to-use language. Integrating this technology in Plasma seems a high priority, and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://labs.morpheuz.eng.br/blog/21/08/2008/plasmoid-with-qedje/&quot;&gt;first experimental Plasmoids&lt;/a&gt; using QEdje have appeared already. It will make it easier to write Plasma interfaces, allowing people with UI design skills (but little programming knowledge) to contribute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BoF about Solaris had a demo of &lt;a href=&quot;http://opensolaris.org/os/community/dtrace/&quot;&gt;DTrace&lt;/a&gt;, which not only &lt;a href=&quot;http://people.fruitsalad.org/adridg/bobulate/index.php?/archives/630-Some-Solaris-Notes.html&quot;&gt;led the developers to a bug&lt;/a&gt;, but also prompted the &lt;a href=&quot;http://utils.kde.org/projects/okteta/&quot;&gt;Okteta&lt;/a&gt; developer to &lt;a href=&quot;http://frinring.wordpress.com/2008/08/18/oktetaakademy-2008/&quot;&gt;have a look&lt;/a&gt; at Okteta running on other platforms like Windows and Mac OS X.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The focus of the session was really more about the developer tools available on the Solaris platform (and also on other platforms, because DTrace can be used on FreeBSD and Mac OSX as well) than the platform itself; some words were said about KDE 4 on Solaris, &quot;it'll be there soon&quot; as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seb Ruiz, one of the Amarokers wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sebruiz.net/343&quot;&gt;in his blog&lt;/a&gt; how the major work in the Amarok Den was critiquing and improving the major components in their GUI. Lydia Pintscher, the Amarok Community Manager, noted &quot;The most important thing about Akademy in my opinion was meeting our Summer of Code students. It really helped to get to know them and make them feel they are part of the team. I hope it helped to convince them to stay with Amarok after SoC. Oh, and we really enjoyed the Akademy Awards Ceremony, obviously.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

We enjoyed good beer at the social event.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;a href=&quot;http://akademy2008.kde.org/events/bof.php#hci&quot;&gt;Human Computing Interface workshop&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://ellen.reitmayr.net/index.php/blog&quot;&gt;Ellen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://weblog.obso1337.org/&quot;&gt;Celeste&lt;/a&gt; focussed on giving developers the tools to make their applications easier to use. Ellen explained: During the Hacking Marathon, we organised a Human Computer Interaction day including various workshops to educate the KDE developers with regards to usability and design practices. This included an introduction to &lt;a href=&quot;http://techbase.kde.org/Projects/Usability/Project_User_Research_Template&quot;&gt;the KDE user research profiles&lt;/a&gt; that will help developers define their project goals and focus their work on the users' needs. In a second workshop, &lt;a href=&quot;http://weblog.obso1337.org/2008/6-research-and-design-methods-for-developers/&quot;&gt;six usability and design methods&lt;/a&gt; were explained to developers which they can can apply to improve the usability of their software.
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Furthermore, in the scope of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://season.openusability.org&quot;&gt;Season of Usability&lt;/a&gt;, we offered a student project to further develop the Human Interface Guidelines and identify common design patterns in KDE 4. Thomas Pfeiffer, one of our student interns, also attended Akademy and together, we documented several design patterns that will soon be available on techbase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Finally, we had a discussion about dialogs. Dialog alignment has been an issue in KDE for about 2 years now. During this year's Akademy, we worked together with several developers to come up with some final guidelines for dialog alignment. They will soon be documented on techbase, including some Qt Designer tips and tricks.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Work and play have to go together. So we had a Nokia-sponsored &lt;a href=&quot;http://akademy2008.kde.org/events/social_event.php&quot;&gt;social event&lt;/a&gt;, were we had good food and Belgian beer. And Thursday we went to Mechelen, and had a great tour over the river, paid for by our own KDE e.V. Many pictures were shot during Akademy, be sure to have a look at those made by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kdedevelopers.org/node/3606&quot;&gt;Bart Coppens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kdedevelopers.org/node/3604&quot;&gt;Jonathan Riddell&lt;/a&gt; or in &lt;a href=&quot;http://vizzzion.org/?id=gallery&amp;amp;gcat=Akademy2008&quot;&gt;Sebas' gallery (who donated the pics in this article)&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Wrapping up&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That wraps up the overview of Akademy. On Friday most people left, though some stayed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nielsvm.org/2008/08/15/akademy-2008-public-kisses-and-flowers/&quot;&gt;until Saturday&lt;/a&gt;, still working. It took everybody a while to get back home (&lt;a href=&quot;http://nowwhatthe.blogspot.com/2008/08/car-accident.html&quot;&gt;not everybody&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://wadejolson.wordpress.com/2008/08/16/living-the-glamourous-life-in-a-one-star-no-tell-motel/&quot;&gt;having a good trip&lt;/a&gt;), and a while to adjust. Alexander Neundorf even speaks of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kdedevelopers.org/node/3622&quot;&gt;&quot;Post Akademy blues&quot;&lt;/a&gt;. Once adjusted, normal life continues. Wade &lt;a href=&quot;http://wadejolson.wordpress.com/2008/08/26/be-careful-of-what-you-wish-for/&quot;&gt;continues to be funny&lt;/a&gt;. And we are still writing code.

Some new members of the KDE e.V. joined at Akademy. So can you!
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But, despite the importance of &lt;a href=&quot;http://hemswell.lincoln.ac.uk/~padams/index.php?entry=entry080831-102422&quot;&gt;coding&lt;/a&gt; and design going on at Akademy, it is not all what our yearly KDE meeting is all about. Talking to enthusiastic fellow KDE developers &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;. The KDE community offers a diversity of bright, interesting and simply amazing people. Meeting those, talking, having dinner or a drink - it is what makes Akademy one of the best things the year brings. There is so much more fun to be had, things to be learnt and work to be done, from art to be drawn to code to be written, you know you want to &lt;a href=&quot;http://kde.org/getinvolved/&quot;&gt;join us&lt;/a&gt;!

           <title>Interview: JOLIE and Service-Oriented Computing Explained</title>
           <description>
             During Akademy 2008, we sat down with Fabrizio Montesi who's working on &lt;a href=&quot;http://jolie.sourceforge.net&quot;&gt;JOLIE&lt;/a&gt; integration in KDE (and Plasma in particular). He explained the mechanics of the technology and what it can do for KDE. Read on for the interview.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hi Fabrizio! Can you introduce yourself?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi! My name is Fabrizio Montesi, I'm Italian and I work as a computer professional. Recently I have founded (together with my colleague Claudio Guidi), &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.italianasoftware.com/&quot;&gt;italianaSoftware s.r.l.&lt;/a&gt;, a company that centers its business around service-oriented software solutions made with JOLIE.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;At Akademy you gave a talk about JOLIE, the technology you are working on. Can you explain the purpose of JOLIE?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, &lt;a href=&quot;http://jolie.sourceforge.net&quot;&gt;JOLIE&lt;/a&gt; is a programming language for service-oriented computing. It is mostly about communication between applications. Usually, applications have communication mechanisms within themselves - in Qt this is done with the signal-slot mechanism. What it does is essentially this: suppose you have a button, and you click it. That button then tells a part of the application to start doing &quot;its thing&quot;, e.g. display an image. Simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, you might want to have something happen in &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; applicaton if you hit that button; that's covered in the software world as well, e.g. on Linux/UNIX by DCOP and D-Bus, on Windows by DCOM. The problem is that these technologies are pretty specific and each one has its own set of limitations (among which the most prominent is that some don't work over networks). JOLIE tries to overcome all these limitations and offer a very simple solution for doing what should indeed be simple: &quot;just send this message to that application in that computer&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;So JOLIE is like a network-enabled D-Bus?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, no, it's more than that. D-Bus is a framework designed to enable application integration in the desktop. JOLIE is a fully-fledged programming language for managing service-oriented architectures and technologies. With JOLIE, you can write flexible service &quot;orchestrators&quot; and compose other services, independently of their technology, in order to gain sophisticated functionality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Now that sounds interesting, &quot;orchestrators&quot; and composition of services, but what does it mean?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me explain this by giving an example. Say that you want to write an application which allows you to buy stuff at stores. You already have services for accessing your bank and said stores, but you lack the application that actually composes these services to make the money transfer and make the store order for you. Then you write an &quot;orchestrator&quot; to combine the services, which would coordinate the services in order to do what you wanted. Note that a JOLIE orchestrator is very easy to write and can make use of any store and bank service that are based on a technology supported by JOLIE (like, for instance, Web Services, REST, and so on).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is what JOLIE is all about - a generic programming language for programming any kind of service or service-oriented architecture, independent of the underlying protocols (JOLIE abstracts the communication away, e.g. D-Bus apps can communicate with a SOAP-based service through JOLIE). And of course, this is incredibly easy to use. In most other languages you'd find it is very hard to write service-oriented code, but JOLIE is all about services. Of course it also provides the normal flow control functions (like the if-else, if-then, while, for, foreach statements), and it adds some specific and powerful tools to handle distributed workflows. The latter help in compensating for network lag and help the programmer to handle complex asynchronous communications. And finally, JOLIE is very safe while doing this, due to the academic work being done.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;So people can quickly write orchestrators to let any number of services work together in any way they want. Now you mentioned academic work, can you tell us a bit more about that? This is actually a research project, right?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, it is. Writing distributed apps is very difficult to get right. JOLIE is based on SOCK, a process algebra for service-oriented computing, so you can make mathematical proofs on JOLIE applications. For example, we are currently developing a tool for checking distributed systems for possible deadlocks. Another advantage is that you can be sure your application does what it is supposed to do if something goes wrong in some part of your distributed workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me give an example of that last point as well. Say, in the previous example, you're ready to order the bank to transfer the money and receive the store receipt. You want this to go fast, so you do two things at once: start the money transaction and wait for the store receipt. Say that the waiting-for-receipt activity receives an error. In that case, the money transaction must be cancelled: you don't want to lose your money for a product that will not be sent to you, right? But you don't want to cancel it at some unknown point. You want to ensure &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; happened to your money at all. So you add a little &quot;revert when an error comes in&quot; thing to the money transaction code. Now, in case of an error from the store, JOLIE will guarantee three things:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if no money has been transferred yet, the transaction won't begin at all;
&lt;li&gt;if the transfer has already started, JOLIE will allow it to finish, then start the reverting action;
&lt;li&gt;if the transaction has finished already, JOLIE will revert it right away.&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this is based on lots of mathematical work to ensure and prove that this works properly. This is a good example of how SOCK is useful in our development process. When we face a very complicated and general problem, we can first build a mathematical framework for solving that problem in SOCK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After developing the whole theoretical framework and proving that it works, we transfer the results into JOLIE.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interesting. So this is an implementation of sound, theoretical work. But why in KDE?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I wanted to bring the benefits of service-oriented computing to desktop users. There are many services out there on the web and in user computers (every D-Bus-enabled application can indeed be seen as a service), but they don't communicate with each other. JOLIE can help with this. There are a few commercial frameworks which do comparable things, but nothing free, nor very good and complete. Now for this to work, I needed to find an organization which would be interested to work on it. I needed a real, open community to work with, so Vista and Mac OS X were off the list... Vista wouldn't have been very good from a technological standpoint either. I further needed the community to be flexible, interested and pro-active.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was following the evolution of open desktop technologies since a long time. KDE has some amazing, cutting-edge technology, and you don't write that kind of stuff without many open discussions. And from reading the blogs I was convinced this community works great, is open and flexible, exactly what I was looking for. For me, GNOME seemed much less flexible, both in terms of people and technology. More importantly, KDE showed with the KDE4 series that the project is not afraid to take a step towards innovation, regardless of the hardships that you can meet along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And with Plasma, I was sold: it felt like a natural choice. JOLIE is based upon a philosophy which emphasizes generic solutions over specific ones in order to create something as flexible and powerful as possible. The same applies to Plasma, and as i've seen in KDE development, it is the vibe you see in pretty much all of KDE.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;OK, so you decide to work with us. How did that go?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I sent an email to Aaron Seigo and he answered back enthusiastically. He happened to have been thinking on very similar topics, but he bumped into the issues JOLIE is built to solve - it's hard to write, compose and communicate with services. On top of that, there are a lot of different communication mechanisms currently used by services all around the world: how to be able to use all of them? These issues are far from trivial, so Aaron was happy to work with us to take advantage of JOLIE. He invited me to come to Tokamak, the Plasma meeting, which I and Claudio did. There we (JOLIE and Plasma teams) found that we clearly had matching ideas. JOLIE and Plasma looked like the perfect match to offer users a flexible and powerful service-oriented experience. So we started a twofold collaboration, aimed to unite the pragmatic world of KDE and the academic world from which JOLIE comes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cool. And now you're at Akademy... How did you end up here, and what do you think about it?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, Aaron and Kevin Ottens invited me to send a talk proposal for Akademy, which I did. I must say Akademy is very interesting, though also very tiring. You find so many great people to speak with here, and I actually did that for the whole time. I've never had so many well informed questions before, too... before and after the presentation! Actually, I think the majority of questions I had during all the presentations I ever gave were asked at Akademy. Of course, this is because there are so many knowledgeable, interested developers here. Many people here will (or already have) actually put some of these ideas to work, so they have questions about it. Getting so much relevant feedback in an academic conference would be unusual: it is more difficult to reach technological collaboration between many different and separated projects. So this has been really great, i've gathered many ideas and issues i'm going to take with me, think about, and work on. And i've left something to think about for others, too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From what I understood, there is already some code?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, that's true. We are already writing a Plasma::Service layer which acts as a bridge to MetaService (a JOLIE orchestrator) on the JOLIE side. This means you can access all services supported by JOLIE in Plasma. You would have to write an orchestrator to compose services, like in the previous e-commerce example. But as you can read in &lt;a href=&quot;http://fmontesi.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;my blog&lt;/a&gt;, there are some cool code examples. One of them is &lt;a href=&quot;http://fmontesi.blogspot.com/2008/07/vision-distributed-presentation.html&quot;&gt;Vision&lt;/a&gt;, a tool which can distribute presentations real-time over several computers. That way several people can view the presentation on their screens synchronized with one another. This even works in a peer-to-peer way, where each of the PC's can distribute it even further. Look in my blog for &lt;a href=&quot;http://jolie.sourceforge.net/videos/vision-previewer.avi&quot;&gt;a screencast&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something else, not available already but we're working on, is exporting data engines from one system to another. So, for example, the &quot;Time&quot; engine on one computer can be queried as a JOLIE system from a remote PC.
All of this is difficult to do right in terms of security, but opens a huge number of opportunities. Think about how easy it will become to start writing remote control Plasmoids, or getting access to a huge amount of information (that of services on the internet) from your desktop.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do you have any concluding words for the KDE community?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes. i'd like to thank (and praise) the KDE community for its openness. I felt at ease from the start, met enthusiasm and innovative ideas, and discovered that the people behind the project are friendly, open-minded and a lot of fun to pass your time with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During these months I have seen that the KDE project is truly innovation-driven. Open-source and community openness are what make this possible, and KDE is showing that it is capable of handling all this (with the KDE e.V., the meetings, and so on). Keep rocking!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thank you for the interview!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for interviewing me. And who knows... see you at next Akademy!&lt;/p&gt;

           <title>Hooray, it's a 4.1.1!</title>
           <description>
             After last week's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kde.org/announcements/announce-3.5.10.php&quot;&gt;update to the KDE 3.5 series&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kde.org/announcements/announce-4.1.1.php&quot;&gt;today's KDE release&lt;/a&gt; updates the stable KDE 4.1 branch to KDE 4.1.1. It bears the codename &lt;em&gt;&quot;Cebidae&quot;&lt;/em&gt; referring to an in-joke often made during Akademy 2008. With only a good month of development time -- and Akademy in between -- the changelog is still impressively long. Pretty much all applications have received the developers' attention, resulting in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kde.org/announcements/changelogs/changelog4_1to4_1_1.php&quot;&gt;long list of bugfixes and improvements&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;The most significant changes are:

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Significant performance, interaction and rendering correctness improvements in KHTML and Konqueror, KDE's webbrowser &lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;User interaction, rendering and stability fixes in Plasma, the KDE4 desktop shell &lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;PDF backend fixes in the document viewer Okular &lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Fixes in Gwenview, the image viewer's thumbnailing, more robust retrieval and display of images with broken metadata &lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Stability and interaction fixes in KMail &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

To find out more about KDE 4.1, please refer to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kde.org/announcements/4.1/&quot;&gt;KDE 4.1.0&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kde.org/announcements/4.0/&quot;&gt;KDE 4.0.0&lt;/a&gt; release notes. KDE 4.1.1 is a recommended update for everyone running KDE 4.1.0. It will be followed up by more x.y.z updates over the next months and ultimately by a new feature release, KDE 4.2.0 this coming January. Enjoy KDE 4.1.1 and let us know your findings.           </description>

           <title>KDE Commit-Digest for 31st August 2008</title>
           <description>
             In &lt;a href=&quot;http://commit-digest.org/issues/2008-08-31/&quot;&gt;this week's KDE Commit-Digest&lt;/a&gt;: Interface work and new applets specialised for use on MID (small form factor) devices, beginnings of applets-in-the-systray, and work on a new calendar popup widget design in &lt;a href=&quot;http://plasma.kde.org/&quot;&gt;Plasma&lt;/a&gt;. A collection of new comic provider sources, and use of &lt;a href=&quot;http://solid.kde.org/&quot;&gt;Solid&lt;/a&gt; to detect network availability in the &quot;Comic&quot; Plasmoid.

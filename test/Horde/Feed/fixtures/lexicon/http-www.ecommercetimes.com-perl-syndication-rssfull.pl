<description>There have been some subtle shifts in digital music this year, trends that will accelerate over the next few months as the holidays near. I'm not talking about MP3 players and the new models to tempt you. Rather, there is an increasing amount of music available that does not require the downloading of songs to a portable device.</description>

			There have been some subtle shifts in digital music this year, trends that will accelerate over the next few months as the holidays near. I'm not talking about MP3 players and the new models to tempt you. Rather, there is an increasing amount of music available that does not require the downloading of songs to a portable device. It's Internet radio on the go, and the trend is emerging as a potentially disruptive market force, putting into question the need for a satellite radio service or even the purchase of music.

			The Las Vegas company that mistakenly double-cashed more than 10,000 casino customer checks worth millions of dollars on Aug. 30 has struck again. This time, ATMs operated by lobal Cash Access deducted money from thousands of bank accounts -- without dispensing any cash. "We're aghast that this has happened," said Scott Betts, president and chief executive of Global Cash, which provides check-cashing and ATM services for casinos nationwide, including Foxwoods Resort Casino and Mohegan Sun.

<title>Cablevision's Great DVR in the Sky</title>
<link>http://www.ecommercetimes.com/rsstory/64558.html</link>
<description>If the nation's largest cable TV operators have their way, the home digital video recorder could soon become a relic. Leading the way is Cablevision Systems, which plans to roll out a system in early 2009 that will let viewers record any show without a DVR, only a digital set-top box. Shows will be stored on Cablevision's servers instead of a home DVR -- a shift the company said could save it upward of $700 million.</description>

<title>Can Crowdsourcing Curtail Patent Abuse?</title>
<link>http://www.ecommercetimes.com/rsstory/64495.html</link>
<description>Some of the biggest players in the technology industry complain that the U.S. patent system is broken -- putting too many patents of dubious merit in the hands of people who can use them to drag companies and other inventors to court. Blaise Mouttet, a small inventor in Alexandria, Va., thinks he knows why. The problem, he said, is that &quot;there are too many lawyers and not enough inventors involved with the patent system.&quot;</description>

Blaise Mouttet, a small inventor in Alexandria, Va., thinks he knows why. The problem, he said, is that "there are too many lawyers and not enough inventors involved with the patent system." So Mouttet is taking part in an experimental program intended to give the public -- including inventors -- more of a voice in the system.

<title>The TV Ad Exodus, Part 2: Melding With the Web</title>
<link>http://www.ecommercetimes.com/rsstory/64552.html</link>
<description>TV advertising's halcyon days appear to be fading further and further in the rear-view mirror. While the medium still carries a lot of clout, its growth rate has slowed, and companies are earmarking their spending for other media. Ironically, these new options may soon lead to a refashioning, if not a rebirth, of TV as an advertising vehicle.</description>

			TV advertising's halcyon days appear to be fading further and further in the rear-view mirror. While the medium still carries a lot of clout, its growth rate has slowed, and companies are earmarking their spending for other media. Ironically, these new options may soon lead to a refashioning, if not a rebirth, of TV as an advertising vehicle. TV advertising has remained flat recently, and it's clear where companies are placing a growing portion of their money: the Internet.

			Enterprise software giant Oracle surpassed Wall Street expectations Friday by reporting a 28 percent boost in profit for the quarter ended Aug. 31. However, Redwood City, Calif.-based Oracle said revenue and profit growth will slow down in the next quarter as the U.S. economy loses steam. The rising strength of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies could siphon a few percentage points off growth in overseas markets, said Oracle CFO Safra Catz.

The missives profess to feature a free game for the smartphone, but the only thing those who download the attachment receive is malware designed to infect PCs running Windows. The scam e-mails purport to include a file dubbed "Penguin.Panic.zip," a supposed version of the popular "Penguin Panic" motion-based iPhone app game, in which a cuddly Penguin jumps from one iceberg to another while avoiding falling icicles.

			A battle is brewing over a secretive intellectual property agreement being negotiated by the U.S. and several other nations. Leaked documents indicate the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement would allow multiple countries to enforce each others' intellectual property laws. That, some fear, could pose substantial risks to your privacy rights. Two public interest groups, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Public Knowledge, filed a lawsuit this week to gain access to the documents. Their previous requests for information, they say, have gone unfilled.

"This leaves me in a rather unique position," Brin writes in his blog, Too. "I know early in my life something I am substantially predisposed to. I now have the opportunity to adjust my life to reduce those odds [e.g. there is evidence that exercise may be protective against Parkinson's]."

			If you're a ninja assassin, a terrorist, an illegal street racer, or any other variety of violent outlaw, you shouldn't look to YouTube for training anymore; you won't find any there. The Google-owned video sharing site has revised its policies to specifically forbid videos that offer instructions on, "bomb making, ninja assassin training, sniper attacks, videos that train terrorists or tips on illegal street racing." YouTube has long banned graphically violent content, but the new rule bans related instructional content even if the violence itself isn't graphically depicted.

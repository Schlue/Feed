      <title>Apple pushes MobileMe surprise to XP, Vista</title>

      <description>&lt;div class="rxbodyfield"&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;Apple installed a control panel applet for its &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/inform.do?command=search&amp;amp;searchTerms=Apple+MobileMe"&gt;MobileMe&lt;/a&gt; online sync and storage service on &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/inform.do?command=search&amp;amp;searchTerms=Microsoft+Windows+XP"&gt;Windows XP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/inform.do?command=search&amp;amp;searchTerms=Microsoft+Windows+Vista"&gt;Windows Vista&lt;/a&gt; systems when they were updated to &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/inform.do?command=search&amp;amp;searchTerms=Apple+iTunes"&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt; 7.7 -- the second time this year that it&amp;#39;s bundled new software with an update for an existing program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="right"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ad.doubleclick.net/jump/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;skey=patch_management;pkey=security;ord=123456789?" target="_blank" /&gt;&lt;img src="http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;skey=patch_management;pkey=security;ord=123456789?" width="336" height="280" border="0" alt="" align="right"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;The anti-malware organization that rebuked Apple for similar tactics in April said it has not had a chance to investigate, but on a general level the group objects to software that&amp;#39;s installed without prior user approval or knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;&lt;b&gt;[ Read the related story &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/06/19/MobileMe_What_you_need_to_know_1.html"&gt;MobileMe: What you need to know&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;quot; And discover the top-rated IT products as rated by the &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/testcenter/?source=fssr"&gt;InfoWorld Test Center&lt;/a&gt;. ]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;Computerworld has confirmed that installing iTunes 7.7, the version required to access Apple&amp;#39;s new iPhone- and iPod touch-specific App Store, also installs a MobileMe control panel in both Windows XP and Windows Vista. The control panel, dubbed &amp;quot;MobileMe Preferences,&amp;quot; is used by subscribers to log into the service, set sync options for Outlook or Internet Explorer, and access MobileMe&amp;#39;s online storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;People who are not yet subscribers are taken to an Apple marketing Web site if they click on the &amp;quot;Learn More&amp;quot; button under a &amp;quot;Try MobileMe&amp;quot; heading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;The end-user licensing agreement (EULA) that accompanies the iTunes 7.7 update makes no mention of the MobileMe software that&amp;#39;s installed on the PC, nor are there any notifications elsewhere during the setup procedure. Also, uninstalling iTunes does not uninstall the MobileMe control panel applet. Instead, users must select &amp;quot;Apple Mobile Device Support&amp;quot; from the &amp;quot;Add or Remove Programs&amp;quot; applet in XP or &amp;quot;Uninstall or change a program&amp;quot; in Vista to uninstall the software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;Apple&amp;#39;s decision to include the MobileMe preferences applet without telling users &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.computerworld.com/apple_snaeks_mobileme_into_vista"&gt;reminded some of the dustup&lt;/a&gt; last spring when the Cupertino, Calif. company &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;amp;articleId=9070558"&gt;offered Safari 3.1 to Windows users&lt;/a&gt; via the Apple Software Update tool, even if they hadn&amp;#39;t had Apple&amp;#39;s browser on their PCs previously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;Back in April, Mozilla Corp., which develops the Firefox open-source browser, objected to the practice, with its CEO, John Lilly, &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;amp;articleId=9071599"&gt;saying&lt;/a&gt; that the practice &amp;quot;borders on malware distribution practices.&amp;quot; Stopbadware.org, an anti-malware advocacy group founded by Google, Lenovo Group, and Sun Microsystems, notified Apple it would soon issue a &amp;quot;badware&amp;quot; alert for Software Update because of the tactics. Apple made that alert moot, however, when it &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;amp;articleId=9078738"&gt;changed the updating tool&lt;/a&gt; so that it separated updates for already-installed programs from offers to install new software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;Maxim Weinstein, manager of Stopbadware.org., stopped short on Monday of calling Apple&amp;#39;s newest move a repeat of the Safari incident. &amp;quot;We haven&amp;#39;t had an opportunity to look at it, so we don&amp;#39;t have a formal evaluation,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;But our guidelines require and the [user] community expects that when an application installs new or different functionality that users are notified and able to consent to that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;Weinstein said that Stopbadware.org would probably look into the MobileMe-iTunes situation in the next week or two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;MobileMe, which has had a &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;amp;taxonomyId=89&amp;amp;articleId=9110400"&gt;rocky start&lt;/a&gt; since its launch a week and a half ago, synchronizes e-mail, contacts and calendars on multiple Macs, PCs, iPhones, and iPod touches; provides Web-based e-mail, contact and scheduling applications; and offers 20GB of storage space for an annual fee of $99.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.computerworld.com/index.jsp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Computerworld&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#160;is an InfoWorld affiliate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div class="rxbodyfield"&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/financial/emc.html"&gt;EMC&lt;/a&gt; is upgrading its Documentum enterprise content management platform with &lt;a href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/2008/052108-chambers-web-2.html" target="_blank"&gt;several Web 2.0 tools&lt;/a&gt; and a software server designed to improve performance of &amp;quot;mass-volume applications&amp;quot; including archiving and transactional content systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="right"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ad.doubleclick.net/jump/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;skey=patch_management;pkey=security;ord=123456789?" target="_blank" /&gt;&lt;img src="http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;skey=patch_management;pkey=security;ord=123456789?" width="336" height="280" border="0" alt="" align="right"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;The Version 6.5 release of EMC Documentum, announced Tuesday, features four new add-ons, including a Web page builder; a rich media interface for reviewing, annotating and sharing rich media files; a personalized client giving users quick access to frequently used content; and new team workspaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;[ Discover the top-rated IT products as rated by the &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/testcenter/?source=fssr"&gt;InfoWorld Test Center&lt;/a&gt;. ]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;EMC also unveiled its Documentum High-Volume Server, which offers &amp;quot;high-speed ingestion, &lt;a href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/2007/031407-active-batch-job-scheduling.html?page=1" target="_blank"&gt;batch processing&lt;/a&gt; [and a] lightweight footprint for &lt;a href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/2007/062707-ibm-metadata.html" target="_blank"&gt;metadata&lt;/a&gt; and data portioning,&amp;quot; technologies designed to keep high-volume applications running smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;EMC is just the latest vendor to hop on the Web 2.0 craze, taking advantage of a trend in which businesses are using more interactive collaboration tools delivered over Web interfaces. &lt;a href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/2008/052108-chambers-web-2.html" target="_blank"&gt;Cisco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/2008/013008-forrester-predictions.html?page=1" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/2007/110707-ibm-microsoft-sap-lag-web20.html" target="_blank"&gt;IBM&lt;/a&gt;, and a raft of startups have charged into the Web 2.0 market as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;With the success of social networking sites geared toward consumers such as Facebook, Flickr, and Del.icio.us, similar tools are trickling into the enterprise, notes Whitney Tidmarsh, vice president of marketing for content management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;&amp;quot;The appeal of those tools is pretty self-evident. It&amp;#39;s just a great way to interact with people,&amp;quot; Tidmarsh says. &amp;quot;I think IT has been cautious and to some degree fearful about what bringing social networking tools in to the enterprise might mean from a &lt;a href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/2008/071508-employees-social-networking.html?fsrc=netflash-rss" target="_blank"&gt;security&lt;/a&gt; and volume perspective.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;The new Web 2.0 add-ons for Documentum will be available either for free or a &amp;quot;nominal&amp;quot; fee that EMC did not disclose. Any charge would be in addition to the base platform. For 100 users, businesses can expect packages starting at $25,000 to $50,000, Tidmarsh says. A global customer with 100,000 employees could easily pay millions of dollars, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;The Web 2.0 add-ons include Documentum CenterStage Essentials, which features shared team workspaces and &amp;quot;guided search.&amp;quot; Similar to iTunes, where you can search by genre or album, EMC is giving customers the option of searching documents by keywords, authors, format type and other categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;CenterStage will be available as a free online beta next month and will be generally available by the end of the year, according to Tidmarsh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;The other new Documentum products will start shipping July 31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;Media WorkSpace, another new item, will be available at no extra charge to customers who have a license for Documentum &lt;a href="http://www.emc.com/products/detail/software/digital-asset-manager.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Digital Asset Manager&lt;/a&gt;, which uses a Web-based interface to manage digital content like product images, streaming video, logos, flash animations, and presentations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;Media WorkSpace gives users a &amp;quot;highly personalized, dynamic and familiar way to view, find compare, annotate, review, and share rich media assets,&amp;quot; EMC states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;The final two new releases, Web Publish Page Builder and My Documentum, will both require an extra payment in addition to regular Documentum license fees. The page builder tool is an Adobe Flex-based Web authoring interface that gives non-technical business users the ability to create attractive Web pages, EMC says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;My Documentum integrates Documentum with programs like Microsoft Outlook and Windows Explorer, &amp;quot;providing users with immediate access to the latest versions of content they use most often as well as allowing them to access and work on documents when they are not connected to the server,&amp;quot; EMC states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.networkworld.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Network World&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#160;is an InfoWorld affiliate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Cast Iron adds data-cleansing to integration appliance</title>
      <link>http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/redirect?source=rss&amp;url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/07/22/Cast_Iron_adds_datacleansing_to_integration_appliance_1.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="rxbodyfield"&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;Cast Iron Systems, maker of an appliance for integrating SaaS and on-premise applications, is introducing a new version that adds data cleansing and migration tools, along with a library of prebuilt integration templates for connecting many commercial software-as-a-service products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="right"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ad.doubleclick.net/jump/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;skey=patch_management;pkey=security;ord=123456789?" target="_blank" /&gt;&lt;img src="http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;skey=patch_management;pkey=security;ord=123456789?" width="336" height="280" border="0" alt="" align="right"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;The iA4000 series is also available in hosted form. Customers are &amp;quot;starting to demand more out of the processes associated with a SaaS application, and integration is the key to that,&amp;quot; said CEO Ken Com&amp;#233;e. For example, a user of a hosted CRM (customer relationship management) system may want to plug their help-desk system into it, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;&lt;b&gt;[Get expert SOA insights from InfoWorld&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/realworldsoa/?source=fssr"&gt;Real World SOA blog&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;Cast Iron developed the data-profiling and conversion functionality on its own. But the company is not looking to compete head-to-head with heavy-duty data-cleansing tools sold by the likes of Informatica, and instead is trying to provide a one-stop shop for a typical SaaS customer&amp;#39;s or independent software vendor&amp;#39;s integration requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;&amp;quot;Could you always bring in an extra tool? The answer is yes,&amp;quot; Com&amp;#233;e said. &amp;quot;But we bring it all in one appliance.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;Beyond the templates, Cast Iron also provides a separate visual designer for mapping data to business processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;Cast Iron, located in Mountain View, California, was formed in 2001 and claims to have hundreds of customers, including British American Tobacco, Peet&amp;#39;s Coffee &amp;amp; Tea and the Sports Authority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;The company generally targets the midmarket, where companies have limited IT resources. It views its competition largely as in-house developers, as opposed to other data integration vendors, said Chandar Pattabhiram, vice president of product marketing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;One Cast Iron customer, the location-based mobile business application provider Gearworks, beta-tested the iA4000 product and is currently using it, said CTO Rob Juncker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;He called the templates &amp;quot;extremely useful&amp;quot; and said new data-cleansing functions help the Eagan, Minnesota, company &amp;#39;&amp;#39;make sure data coming into our system is meeting requirements.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;Pricing for Cast Iron starts at $1,500 per month. The iA4000 sells for $4,500.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>New mobile browsers bringing real Web to handhelds</title>
      <link>http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/redirect?source=rss&amp;url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/07/22/New_mobile_browsers_bringing_real_Web_to_handhelds_1.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="rxbodyfield"&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;A new generation of mobile Web browsers is finally making the Web a reality on handheld devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="right"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ad.doubleclick.net/jump/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;skey=patch_management;pkey=security;ord=123456789?" target="_blank" /&gt;&lt;img src="http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;skey=patch_management;pkey=security;ord=123456789?" width="336" height="280" border="0" alt="" align="right"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;The latest example is last week&amp;#39;s beta launch of &lt;a target="_blank" href="www.opera.com/products/mobile"&gt;Opera Mobile 9.5&lt;/a&gt;, a native Web browser for high-end &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.networkworld.com/topics/pdas.html"&gt;smartphones&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#39;s an evolutionary release for the Norwegian software company, but it comes just days after &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/financial/apple.html"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s iPhone 3G, with its highly capable Safari browser, went on sale. Other brand-new entrants, such as Mobile Firefox and Skyfire, are expected later this year, at least in beta form.&amp;#160;( &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.networkworld.com/slideshows/2008/072108-mobile-browsers.html"&gt;See slideshow of new mobile browsers&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;&lt;b&gt;[ Get the latest on mobile developments with InfoWorld&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/newsletter/subscribe.html?source=fssr"&gt;Mobile Report newsletter&lt;/a&gt;. ]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;But the evolving mobile browsers are only one part of the picture. Mobile browsing is affected by the client hardware, ranging from the processor to the kind of wireless network being used, all of which have improved markedly. It&amp;#39;s also affected by the design of Web sites being targeted, and there&amp;#39;s new attention being focused on optimizing these sites for mobile users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;When everything comes together, the results can be impressive. In the United States, the combination of the iPhone&amp;#39;s large screen, touch interface and Safari has given mobile users a new way of viewing the Web: the way they&amp;#39;re used to seeing it with their PC-based Web browsers. Until now, most users struggled with so-called microbrowsers, which typically access separately created and maintained Web content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;StatCounter reported in March that &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/safari"&gt;Safari&lt;/a&gt; /iPhone was the No. 1 mobile browser in the United States, and No. 2 globally, trailing the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.nokia.com/"&gt;Nokia&lt;/a&gt; Web browser. Google released &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/14/technology/14apple.html?_r=1&amp;amp;oref=slogin"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; in January showing that Christmas traffic to its site from iPhone users outstripped all other mobile devices, at a point when the iPhone had just 2 percent of the smartphone market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;The lesson was clear: Give mobile users a browser they could actually use . . . and they&amp;#39;d use it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No more second-class browsing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;&amp;quot;Mobile browsing was considered a second-class citizen on the Web,&amp;quot; says Matt Womer, the Mobile Web Initiative Lead, Americas, with the Worldwide Web Consortium (W3C). &amp;quot;You had to serve completely different content, with a different markup [language] and different protocols.&amp;quot; Those were the days of such early browsers as Phone.com/OpenWave, and the Wireless Access Protocol (WAP), a markup for creating mobile-friendly Web content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;The iPhone Safari browser, though not the first full Web browser for handhelds, crystallized a huge change in thinking. &amp;quot;There&amp;#39;s [now] a convergence of the desktop Web and the mobile device Web,&amp;quot; says Mike Rowehl, scalability architect for start-up Skyfire Labs, which is &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/2008/070908-skyfire-qa.html"&gt;creating&lt;/a&gt; a thin-client mobile browser, with most of the heavy-lifting work being done by the core Firefox desktop browser running on servers. &amp;quot;The iPhone really cracked that open, and people are starting to think differently about the services on their device.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;&amp;quot;People browsing the Web from a mobile device don&amp;#39;t expect an &amp;#39;alternative universe&amp;#39; which lacks features they&amp;#39;re used to,&amp;quot; says Jay Sullivan, vice president of mobile for Mozilla, overseeing the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/2008/070908-mozilla-mobile-firefox.html?tc=wm"&gt;Mobile Firefox&lt;/a&gt; project, which will shortly release its alpha test version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next generation of mobile browsers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;There is a range of vendors vying to win the browsing allegiance of mobile users. Opera Software launched one of the earliest of these browsers in 2000, Opera Mobile. The company says the 9.5 release will rival desktop browsing in &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/2008/020508-opera-mobile-claims-desktop-speed.html"&gt;speed&lt;/a&gt;. In early 2006, Opera Mini was introduced for less-capable phones. Another is the browser widely used in Symbian-based mobile phones, such as those from Nokia. Still another offering is Bitstream&amp;#39;s two-year-old ThunderHawk browser, which the company earlier this year ported to Qualcomm&amp;#39;s Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless (BREW) , a Java-based application development platform for mobile phones, to make for the first mass-market release of the browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;In development are Mobile Firefox, a client browser, and &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/2008/012808-startup-sets-full-mobile-browser.html"&gt;Skyfire&lt;/a&gt;, with a thin client working with desktop Firefox 3.0 running on servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;All of them have in common powerful, modern rendering engines, which make it possible for the browsers to display Web sites that look like those you see with a desktop browser. Safari and the Nokia browser use the same rendering engine: the open source &lt;a href="http://www.webkit.org/"&gt;WebKit&lt;/a&gt; . All Firefox projects use the same rendering engine, &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Gecko"&gt;Gecko&lt;/a&gt;. Opera has over a decade invested in its core engine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;Programs this powerful and complex, even when highly optimized for memory use, need powerful and complex devices to run on. But currently, most mobile phones are low- to midrange designs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;&amp;quot;Lots of people have tried to access their favorite Web sites [with the default microbrowser] and failed,&amp;quot; Sampo Kaasila, vice president of R&amp;amp;D for &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.bitstream.com/"&gt;Bitstream&lt;/a&gt;, in Cambridge, Mass. &amp;quot;They conclude &amp;#39;the mobile Web doesn&amp;#39;t work for me.&amp;#39; But with Opera Mini, it will work for e-mail, news and social networking. That&amp;#39;s key for building the industry as a whole.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thin browsers emerge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;Several vendors are creating thin-client browsers, such as Skyfire, ThunderHawk, and Opera Mini. They run the rendering and other processing on server farms, which have fiber connections to the Internet, and send to the lightweight mobile client simply a representation of the Web page on phones that could never run a full mobile browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;With this approach, the vendors also can consistently implement improvements like data compression. Bitstream uses its own compression technology to create what executives say is a 23-to-1 reduction in over-the-air data sizes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;But many mobile browsers, and the major HTTP server platforms, already support a compression utility called &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.gzip.org/"&gt;gzip&lt;/a&gt; (short for GNU zip), though it apparently is not routinely used, according to Jason Grigsby, vice president and Web strategist for Cloud Four, a Portland, Ore., Web development shop that increasingly focuses on mobile applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;When activated on both the browser and Web server, Gzip compresses content typically by 75 percent&amp;#160;to 80 percent on the server before sending it to the browser for decompression. Grigsby, who makes presentation on mobile Web performance, says he constantly hears from Web developers that these kinds of performance issues are new to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;In the course of creating an online performance test for mobile browsers, Grigsby and another colleague spent 36 hours trying to figure out why some versions of BlackBerry&amp;#39;s browser displayed the thumbnail-sized test images and others didn&amp;#39;t. It turned out to be a bug in how the browser added an image to the page. &amp;quot;It points to the fact that the [mobile] browser has not been a focus of RIM&amp;#39;s development, and it&amp;#39;s not up to modern browsing standards,&amp;quot; Grigsby says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trade-offs and frustrations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;For developers the advent of such browsers can bring constant and frustrating trade-offs between industry standards and vendor innovations and extensions. &amp;quot;The iPhone has a whole slough of iPhone-specific Cascading Style Sheet extensions, which let you do things that you can&amp;#39;t do with CSS on other browsers,&amp;quot; says Grigsby. ThunderHawk makes use of Bitstream&amp;#39;s patented font technology, substituting its own fonts and creating several magnification levels to increase the legibility of text on mobile screens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;&amp;quot;More standardization is needed,&amp;quot; Grigsby says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;The W3C&amp;#39;s Mobile Web Initiative has created a set of &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/mobile-bp/"&gt;best practices&lt;/a&gt; for optimizing Web site design to improve browsing for mobile users. It&amp;#39;s expected to become a formal W3C recommendation in the next two months, says Matt Womer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;But there&amp;#39;s a limit to standardization. Browsing on a given mobile device is highly individualized by the device capabilities, the browser design decisions, and the user&amp;#39;s interaction with both. Every vendor in this article displays a full Web page on a phone screen. But after that, how you work with it can vary widely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;The iPhone&amp;#39;s touch interface clearly has made browsing easy for users but it&amp;#39;s just as clearly a high-end phone. Mozilla&amp;#39;s Mobile Firefox project is crafting both a touch and a nontouch user interface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;Bitstream&amp;#39;s ThunderHawk shows at the top of the screen what the company calls a &amp;quot;minimap&amp;quot; of the entire Web page, outlining the section of the page being viewed by the user, with clickable &amp;quot;hotspots&amp;quot; to other parts of the page. The minimap is an aid to navigating the full page quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;Opera Mobile 9.5 borrows from Opera Mini to now show a full Web page, then let users pan and zoom to find and focus on specific areas. A grayed-out upside down &amp;quot;V&amp;quot; on the bottom right of the screen gives one-click access to an overlay page of standard browser buttons and actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;It all adds up to new opportunities, and new headaches. &amp;quot;The browser wars are back and this time the battlefield is mobile,&amp;quot; says Grigsby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.networkworld.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Network World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#160;is an InfoWorld affiliate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Symbian: R&amp;D wants motivated open sourcing</title>
      <link>http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/redirect?source=rss&amp;url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/07/22/oscon-symbian_1.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="rxbodyfield"&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;Research and development efficiency, and not competitive concerns about the Google Android or Linux Mobile (LiMo) initiatives, was a chief driver in the decision to make the Symbian mobile platform open source, a Symbian official said Monday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="right"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ad.doubleclick.net/jump/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;skey=patch_management;pkey=security;ord=123456789?" target="_blank" /&gt;&lt;img src="http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;skey=patch_management;pkey=security;ord=123456789?" width="336" height="280" border="0" alt="" align="right"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;Symbian, &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/06/24/Nokia_buys_rest_of_Symbian_will_make_code_open_source_1.html" class="regularArticleU"&gt;which is being made an open source project by Nokia&lt;/a&gt;, is to be provided by an Eclipse license in the 2009-2010 timeframe, said John Forsyth, vice president of strategy for Symbian, at the &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/07/21/Linux-set-to-make-mobile-splash_1.html" class="regularArticleU"&gt;Open Mobile Exchange&lt;/a&gt; conference being held as part of the Open Source Conference (OSCON) in Portland, Ore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;He acknowledged there has been much speculation about why Symbian, a successful project that he said has a 60 percent share of the mobile market, was going open source. But Symbian has had a lack of research and development efficiency, according to Forsyth. "This was one of our biggest barriers to growth," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;"I think that [Android and LiMo] are not really the motivation behind doing this. I think the biggest motivation behind this is, as I said, R&amp;amp;D efficiency," Forsyth said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;Explaining research and development efficiency problems, Forsyth said that currently, engineering efforts get duplicated by phone manufacturers. Also, there is no mobile-specific open-source community, which is what Symbian plans to offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;Linux, meanwhile, has suffered from fragmentation, he argued. Some of Symbian's customers use Linux and end up with their own specific branch of Linux for mobile usage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;"It effectively becomes a proprietary platform," said Forsyth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;Another motivating factor for Symbian is that users do not want a single-source technology provider, he said. Those overseeing Symbian decided that to break through to the next level of success, the platform needed to be free, independent, and neutral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;Challenges to the open-source project include creating a culture and dealing with customers with different levels of open-source knowledge. The community also must grow in the right way. The foundation plans to design with transparency, get technical authorities who are independent, and give people a voice, said Forsyth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;"I'm going to wrap up by stating the unbelievably obvious: that we're going to make a lot of mistakes as we do this," Forsyth said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;Commenting on features, Forsyth said symmetric multiprocessing is anticipated for Symbian in the 2011 timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;The Symbian foundation will run the open-source project, Forysth said&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Brocade to buy Foundry for $3 billion</title>
      <link>http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/redirect?source=rss&amp;url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/07/22/Brocade_to_buy_Foundry_for_3_billion_1.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="rxbodyfield"&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;Storage networking company Brocade Communications Systems has agreed to acquire enterprise LAN vendor Foundry Networks for approximately $3 billion, the companies announced Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="right"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ad.doubleclick.net/jump/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;skey=patch_management;pkey=security;ord=123456789?" target="_blank" /&gt;&lt;img src="http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;skey=patch_management;pkey=security;ord=123456789?" width="336" height="280" border="0" alt="" align="right"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;Brocade said the deal will make it a top provider of networking gear for enterprises and service providers, by allowing it to offer a full line of products that extends from the Internet to wide- and local-area networks and into the datacenter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;&lt;b&gt;[ Discover the top-rated IT products as rated by the &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/testcenter/?source=fssr"&gt;InfoWorld Test Center&lt;/a&gt;. ]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;The deal has been approved by the boards of both companies and is expected to close in the fourth quarter, pending approval by Foundry&amp;#39;s stockholders and other closing conditions, Brocade said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;Brocade will pay $18.50 in cash plus about one-tenth of a share of Brocade stock for each share of Foundry, for a total of $19.25 per share. Brocade expects to fund the deal with cash from both companies and $1.5 billion of debt financing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;Datacenters and enterprise LANs, which typically are built with different network technologies, are widely expected to converge on Ethernet with a still-emerging standard called Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE). Foundry is one of a handful of longtime Ethernet LAN vendors that have lived in the shadow of Cisco Systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;&amp;quot;Our business models and technologies are extremely synergistic,&amp;quot; Marty Lans, Brocade senior director of product management for data center infrastructure, said in an interview. Foundry has &amp;quot;the best technology and the broadest set of features,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;The companies do not expect to make layoffs following the deal, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;Foundry was founded in 1996 and has about 1,100 employees. It posted its preliminary second-quarter financial results Monday. Revenue was $160.7 million, up from $143.2 million in the same quarter last year. Net income was $18.3 million, up from $15.6 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;The combined company will be led by Brocade CEO Michael Klayko and will use only the Brocade brand, although product names from Foundry will remain, executives said on a conference call following the announcement. The companies haven&amp;#39;t defined a role for Bobby Johnson, Foundry&amp;#39;s founder, president and CEO, but said the 30-year networking veteran would stay on board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m committed to making this happen, and I&amp;#39;m committed to helping Mike and both teams,&amp;quot; Johnson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;Brocade executives contrasted the Foundry deal with Brocade&amp;#39;s 2006 acquisition of McData, where there were many overlapping products and a key driver of the deal was cost savings. They expect this buyout to boost revenue and increase Brocade&amp;#39;s earnings beginning in its 2009 fiscal year, which will end in October 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;Customers want to address the challenges of rapid data growth with reliable and integrated systems that reduce complexity, Klayko said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;&amp;quot;The networks of today, from the Internet, to corporate LANs, to mission-critical datacenters, are undergoing dramatic, dynamic change and architectural reconsideration,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;The combined company will be the only &amp;quot;alternative&amp;quot; with reach all the way from the Internet to datacenters, he said. Cisco, the dominant LAN and WAN vendor, has that reach today and is a growing force in datacenters, according to Greg Schulz, an analyst at StorageIO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;Cisco and Brocade are approaching convergence of LANs and datacenter networks from opposite directions, and Brocade needs to bulk up for the fight, Schulz said. The confrontation goes all the way into technology itself, with each company backing a different interim technology on the way to FCoE, which is expected to eventually become the industry standard, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s very much in the trash-talking, pre-fight runup,&amp;quot; Schulz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;However, the Foundry deal won&amp;#39;t affect the timeline for Foundry&amp;#39;s delivery of next-generation products, including FCoE products, Brocade said. Those products are independent of what Foundry brings to the table, but the deal expands Brocade&amp;#39;s scope, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;Brocade brings a higher profile outside the U.S., while Foundry has a strong position in federal government accounts, the companies said. Brocade will continue to sell primarily through OEMs (original equipment manufacturers), while Foundry uses direct sales and channel partners. In at least one case, that could be awkward: Hewlett-Packard is a Brocade OEM and a LAN competitor to Foundry. The executives said discussions have taken place with HP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;As a possible sign of how much it needs Foundry, Brocade&amp;#39;s offer of $19.25 per share is a significant premium for the company. Foundry shares on the Nasdaq closed Monday, before the announcement, at $13.66. Late Monday, those shares had risen in after-hours trading to more than $18. Brocade had fallen after hours to $7.09 from $8.33 at market close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div class="rxbodyfield"&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;A Japanese software company is stepping up international promotion of its Web browser in the hope of carving out a 5 percent share over the next few years of a market dominated by Internet Explorer and Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="right"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ad.doubleclick.net/jump/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;skey=patch_management;pkey=security;ord=123456789?" target="_blank" /&gt;&lt;img src="http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;skey=patch_management;pkey=security;ord=123456789?" width="336" height="280" border="0" alt="" align="right"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;The &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.fenrir.co.jp/en/sleipnir/"&gt;Sleipnir&lt;/a&gt; browser is well-known among Japanese geeks, many of whom value the high level of customization that the browser allows. At the center of this customization is the ability to select either the Trident or Gecko layout engines for each Web site visited. Trident was developed by Microsoft and is used in Internet Explorer while Gecko is used in Mozilla&amp;#39;s Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;&lt;b&gt;[ Discover the top-rated IT products as rated by the &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/testcenter/?source=fssr"&gt;InfoWorld Test Center&lt;/a&gt;. ]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;As any user who has changed Web browsers knows, some sites look different or offer different functionality depending on the browser in use. By clicking a small button in the bottom left of the browser and switching between Trident and Gecko users can choose the best one for the particular site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;Fenrir, which is based in Osaka, began development of the browser in 2005 and has been offering an English version alongside its main Japanese version for some time but decided to step-up promotion overseas after noticing demand rising for the browser from international users, said Yasuhiro Miki, director of the overseas marketing division, at Fenrir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;&amp;quot;We&amp;#39;d like to focus on advanced users,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;In the next couple of years, Fenrir hopes to dramatically grow its user base from the current roughly 100,000 users to around 17 million, said Miki. That corresponds to about 5 percent of the English-speaking Web user base, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;In Japan the browser has a 9 percent market share, according to Fenrir. No independent data to verify that claim is available but a recent survey of 3,003 computer programmers published by Nikkei ITpro put Sleipnir&amp;#39;s share at 6 percent among that group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;Initially the focus is on the English-speaking market but Fenrir has plans to look at other language versions including Spanish and French.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div class="rxbodyfield"&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;A computer security company on Monday inadvertently published details of a major flaw in the Internet&amp;#39;s Domain Name System (DNS) several weeks before they were due to be disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="right"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ad.doubleclick.net/jump/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;skey=patch_management;pkey=security;ord=123456789?" target="_blank" /&gt;&lt;img src="http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;skey=patch_management;pkey=security;ord=123456789?" width="336" height="280" border="0" alt="" align="right"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;The flaw was discovered several months ago by IOActive researcher Dan Kaminsky, who worked through the early part of this year with Internet software vendors such as Microsoft, Cisco, and the Internet Systems Consortium to patch the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;[ Read the related story on how&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/07/10/Talk_of_Internet_bug_spawns_backlash_from_hackers_1.html"&gt;talk of the Internet bug spawned a backlash from hackers&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;. ]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;The companies released a fix for the bug two weeks ago and encouraged corporate users and Internet service providers to patch their DNS systems as soon as possible. Although the problem could affect some home users, it is not considered to be a major issue for consumers, according to Kaminsky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;At the time he announced the flaw, Kaminsky asked members of the security research community to hold off on public speculation about its precise nature in order to give users time to patch their systems. Kaminsky had planned to disclose details of the flaw during a presentation at the Black Hat security conference set for Aug. 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;Some researchers took the request as a personal challenge to find the flaw before Kaminsky&amp;#39;s talk. Others complained at being kept in the dark about the technical details of his finding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;On Monday, Zynamics.com CEO Thomas Dullien (who uses the hacker name Halvar Flake)&amp;#160; &lt;a href="http://addxorrol.blogspot.com/2008/07/on-dans-request-for-no-speculation.html" target="_blank"&gt;took a guess&lt;/a&gt; at the bug, admitting that he knew very little about DNS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;His findings were quickly confirmed by Matasano Security, a vendor that had been briefed on the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;&amp;quot;The cat is out of the bag. Yes, Halvar Flake figured out the flaw Dan Kaminsky will announce at Black Hat,&amp;quot; Matasano said in a blog posting that was removed within five minutes of its 1:30 p.m. Eastern publication. Copies of the post were soon circulating on the Internet, one of which was viewed by IDG News Service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;Matasano&amp;#39;s post discusses the technical details of the bug, saying that by using a fast Internet connection, an attacker could launch what&amp;#39;s known as a DNS cache poisoning attack against a Domain Name Server and succeed, for example, in redirecting traffic to malicious Web sites within about 10 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;Matasano Researcher Thomas Ptacek declined to comment on whether or not Flake had actually figured out the flaw, but in a telephone interview he said the item had been &amp;quot;accidentally posted too soon.&amp;quot; Ptacek was one of the few security researchers who had been given a detailed briefing on the bug and had agreed not to comment on it before details were made public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;Matasano&amp;#39;s post inadvertently confirmed that Flake had described the flaw correctly, Ptacek admitted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;Late Monday, Ptacek &lt;a href="http://www.matasano.com/log/1105/regarding-the-post-on-chargen-earlier-today/" target="_blank"&gt;apologized&lt;/a&gt; to Kaminsky on his company blog. &amp;quot;We regret that it ran,&amp;quot; he wrote. &amp;quot;We removed it from the blog as soon as we saw it. Unfortunately, it takes only seconds for Internet publications to spread.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;Kaminsky&amp;#39;s attack takes advantage of several known DNS bugs, combining them in a novel way, said Cricket Liu vice president of architecture with DNS appliance vendor Infoblox, after viewing the Matasano post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;The bug has to do with the way DNS clients and servers obtain information from other DNS servers on the Internet. When the DNS software does not know the numerical IP (Internet Protocol) address of a computer, it asks another DNS server for this information. With cache poisoning, the attacker tricks the DNS software into believing that legitimate domains, such as idg.com, map to malicious IP addresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;In Kaminsky&amp;#39;s attack a cache poisoning attempt also includes what is known as &amp;quot;Additional Resource Record&amp;quot; data. By adding this data, the attack becomes much more powerful, security experts say. &amp;quot;The combination of them is pretty bad,&amp;quot; Liu said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;An attacker could launch such an attack against an Internet service provider&amp;#39;s domain name servers and then redirect them to malicious servers. By poisoning the domain name record for www.citibank.com, for example, the attackers could redirect the ISP&amp;#39;s users to a malicious phishing server every time they tried to visit the banking site with their Web browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;Kaminsky declined to confirm that Flake had discovered his issue, but in a posting to his Web site Monday he &lt;a href="http://www.doxpara.com/?p=1176" target="_blank"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;13&amp;gt;0,&amp;quot; apparently a comment that the 13 days administrators have had to patch his flaw before its public disclosure is better than nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;&amp;quot;Patch. Today. Now. Yes, stay late,&amp;quot; he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;He has posted a test on his &lt;a href="http://www.doxpara.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Web site&lt;/a&gt; that anyone can run to find our if their network&amp;#39;s DNS software is patched&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>How to handle SOA vendor consolidation</title>
      <link>http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/redirect?source=rss&amp;url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/07/22/30NF-soa-market-consolidation_1.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="rxbodyfield"&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;The SOA concept -- developing a software architecture based on service components that can be mixed and matched as needed to reduce development time and increase application deployment flexibility -- is only a few years old, but the providers of SOA-supporting infrastructure are fast consolidating. Oracle captured the headlines with its &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/07/01/Oracle-reveals-BEA-roadmap_1.html" class="regularArticleU"&gt;acquisition of BEA Systems&lt;/a&gt; this spring, and &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/06/25/Progress_buys_Iona_for_SOA_wares_1.html" class="regularArticleU"&gt;Progress Software recently bought Iona Technologies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="right"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ad.doubleclick.net/jump/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;skey=patch_management;pkey=security;ord=123456789?" target="_blank" /&gt;&lt;img src="http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;skey=patch_management;pkey=security;ord=123456789?" width="336" height="280" border="0" alt="" align="right"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;That means the choices for infrastructure providers -- from enterprise service buses (ESBs) to shared code repositories -- is shrinking just as more companies are exploring SOA. A few vendors such as IBM and Oracle now offer the convenience of a soup-to-nuts SOA platform, but at the risk of locking in their customers to a proprietary stack or selling them more than they need as part of a suite or package.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;[ Get&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;past the vendor hype and find out what's real in SOA in InfoWorld's &lt;a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/realworldsoa/?source=fssr" class="regularArticleU"&gt;Real World SOA blog&lt;/a&gt;. ]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;For example, Delaware Electric had to fend off IBM's attempt to sell more than the utility needed, says CFO Garry Cripps. "IBM behaved like most vendors I deal with: They tried to up-sell me for the highest horsepower whether I needed it or not," he says. (Cripps is pleased with the IBM WebSphere Process Server he did buy to manage SOA services.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;Vendors such as Hewlett-Packard, Itko, Software AG, Tibco, and WSO2 that offer specific SOA platform components will continue to exist. But some of them fear that because their customers increasingly are using platform offerings from the large vendors, they could be displaced by the larger vendor, either because it offers a similar component or doesn't integrate well with the smaller vendor's tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;For example, Software AG says that IBM's claim of integration with and accommodation of other vendors' products is misleading, putting it at a disadvantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Not as simple as "soup to nuts" versus "best of breed"&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;But the choices in the SOA market are not so clearly between proprietary but integrated stacks and "best of breed," but rather nonintegrated components, says Randy Heffner, a Forrester Research analyst. That's because by its nature, SOA uses standard interfaces such as SOAP, WSDL, BPEL, and XML to connect services to each other. Thus, even a large vendor like IBM is forced to compete with a startup like WSO2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;In a true SOA approach, individual services can run over proprietary infrastructure, but the interfaces among them typically adhere to the established standards. That reduces lock-in risk to the infrastructure, not the applications running over them, Heffner says -- but only if IT avoids vendors' proprietary extensions to those standards. "There are a lot of extensions beyond the specifications," he notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;Also, because most SOA efforts seek to reuse existing applications wherever possible, IT will have to do custom coordination no matter how integrated the SOA platform. That helps blunt the "one provider" argument.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;"With SOA, there's a lot of legacy products, so you have to write your own pieces," said Brad Svee, manager of IT development at Concur Technologies, a provider of expense reporting and travel management services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;Enterprise architects assembling an SOA have three strategies, according to a recent Forrester study by Heffner. These include a single-vendor, "best of breed," or specialized approach (using a proprietary framework developed for or by the company).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="2"&gt;"Focusing on one vendor provides the benefit of reducing finger-pointing between vendors when things go wrong," Heffner says, but that doesn't mean having to choose a single provider for your SOA infrastructure. Instead, companies that don't want to manage lots of vendors for their SOA infrastructure can use an integrator to handle the various providers or choose a primary vendor that then manages the other providers. "Forrester's rule of thumb is to focus on a primary vendor without ruling out 'best of breed' substitutions," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="2"&gt;IT's challenge is to figure out the right way to deploy its architecture, which is where the SOA infrastructure choices come up. At a practical level, most companies already have some SOA infrastructure in place, such as EAI (enterprise application integration) middleware, Web services and related Web platforms, and messaging middleware. That established infrastructure often determines who will provide the rest of the SOA infrastructure, says Tim Hall, director of Hewlett-Packard's SOA Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="2"&gt;For example, a company that has standardized on Oracle for these systems will likely go to Oracle for the rest of the SOA platform. But a company with heterogeneous systems in place is likely to continue buying "best of breed" components from a variety of vendors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="2"&gt;"You talk to major customers, and they have some flavor of middleware from all these companies. The question is it's not so much the issue of what you select but how do you use what you have [effectively]," Hall says. Almost every customer has middleware from different vendors, agrees Sandy Carter, IBM's vice president of SOA and WebSphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="2"&gt;That heterogeneous reality means that many customers pick and choose their SOA infrastructure components as well, says Miko Matsumura, product marketing manager at Software AG: "Not all of our customers have every single component [that Software AG provides]."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="2"&gt;&lt;b&gt;A tour of SOA infrastructure providers&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;Vendors tend to promote themselves as offering pretty much everything a customer requires, says Forrester's Heffner. "All of them would say, 'We can do all or most all of what you need,'" directly or through partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="2"&gt;Here's what the major providers actually offer themselves:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="2"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hewlett-Packard:&lt;/b&gt; HP offers SOA governance tools and a services registry through its acquisition of Mercury Software, as well as quality management tools through its purchase of Talking Blocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="2"&gt;&lt;b&gt;IBM:&lt;/b&gt; Big Blue's SOA wares include an ESB, a process server, a portal, a mashup engine, an application server, and capabilities for business services. IBM's Tivoli unit provides services management software, and IBM's acquisition of AppSoft adds event processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="2"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Itko&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; The company provides SOA test and validation tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="2"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Microsoft:&lt;/b&gt; The software giant doesn't offer SOA products per se, but it positions products such as BizTalk Server and Windows Communication Foundation as an ESB without actually having an ESB in its product catalog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="2"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Oracle:&lt;/b&gt; Its SOA arsenal includes an ESB, a BPEL process manager, business activity monitoring, and Web services management. Oracle also acquired a repository in its BEA buy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="2"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Progress Software:&lt;/b&gt; The company is putting together a wide roster of SOA tools through aggressive acquisition, most recently of Iona for SOA services management. It has also bought ESB provider Sonic Systems, application infrastructure company Mindreef, Web services management vendor Actional, integration provider Pantero, and complex event processing firm Apama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="2"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Software AG:&lt;/b&gt; The company offers a wide palette of SOA products for governance, design, runtime, business process management, and business activity monitoring, as well as a composite application framework. An ESB is on the roster, thanks to the company's &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/07/04/05/HNsoftwareagwebmethods_1.html" class="regularArticleU"&gt;acquisition of WebMethods&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="2"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tibco&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; The vendor's offerings include a runtime platform, an ESB, and a registry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="2"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WSO2:&lt;/b&gt; Taking the open source approach to SOA, WSO2 bills itself as a full-service provider, offering an ESB, a registry, identity management, a Web services application server, and a mashup server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Implicit &lt;a href="http://dockets.justia.com/docket/court-wawdce/case_no-2:2008cv01080/case_id-153090/"&gt;filed its lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; in Washington Western District Court on July 15, just five months after suing AMD, &lt;a href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/financial/intel.html"&gt;Intel,&lt;/a&gt; Nvidia, &lt;a href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/financial/intel.html"&gt;Sun&lt;/a&gt; , Raza Microelectronics, and RealNetworks in the same venue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;While the first Implicit Networks lawsuit puts rivals AMD and Intel on the same side in court, the July lawsuit also places rivals &lt;a href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/financial/oracle.html"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#160;and SAP together as defendants. Oracle, meanwhile, is still pursuing a &lt;a href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/2008/041808-oracle-to-expand-sap-lawsuit.html"&gt;legal action against SAP&lt;/a&gt; , which claims SAP illegally accessed Oracle&amp;#39;s customer support systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;The Implicit lawsuit against AMD and Intel centers around a &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/patents?id=EpEMAAAAEBAJ&amp;amp;dq=%22implicit+networks%22"&gt;2003 patent&lt;/a&gt; covering technology for &amp;quot;demultiplexing packets of a message.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;In the new lawsuit, Bloomberg reports that Implicit Networks is seeking royalties from such products as IBM&amp;#39;s Websphere Application Server, Oracle&amp;#39;s Application Server and BEA WebLogic Server, SAP&amp;#39;s NetWeaver and Adobe&amp;#39;s JRun and ColdFusion. The suit centers around two patents issued to Implicit after applications filed by the company in 1998 and 2001. IBM, Oracle, SAP, and Adobe are expected to issue formal responses in court by Sept. 18, Bloomberg reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div class="rxbodyfield"&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;Intel Sunday announced that it has dropped the price of seven processors by up to 31 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="right"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ad.doubleclick.net/jump/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;skey=patch_management;pkey=security;ord=123456789?" target="_blank" /&gt;&lt;img src="http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;skey=patch_management;pkey=security;ord=123456789?" width="336" height="280" border="0" alt="" align="right"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;There were three price cuts in Intel&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/inform.do?command=search&amp;amp;searchTerms=Intel+Core+Duo"&gt;Core 2 Duo&lt;/a&gt; chip family. The 3.16 GHz Core 2 Duo E8500 was cut from $266 to $183 as of July 20. That 31 percent&amp;#160;drop greatly outpaced all the other cuts, which ranged from 11 to 15 percent, according to an Intel &lt;a href="http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/INTC/364367465x0x214013/BBD2E887-3C94-40FE-B83F-E747BF181974/July_20_08_1ku_Price.pdf"&gt;price list&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;The price of the Core 2 Duo 2.53 GHz E2700 chip was cut by 15&amp;#160;percent cut to $113, and the 3 GHz E8400 by 11 percent&amp;#160;to $163. In addition the price tag for the company&amp;#39;s Core 2 Q6600 2.4 GHz quad processor was reduced from $224 to $1993, a 14 percent drop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;Three cuts also came in the &lt;a href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/inform.do?command=search&amp;amp;searchTerms=Intel+Xeon+Processor"&gt;Xeon&lt;/a&gt; server processor family, with prices of both the X3220 and the X3210 reduced by 12 percent. The price of the E3110 dropped by 11 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;In April, Intel had &lt;a href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;amp;articleId=9079419"&gt;slashed the prices&lt;/a&gt; on about a dozen of its processors up to 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;Dan Olds, principal analyst with the Gabriel Consulting Group, said Intel is simply trying to keep its product moving out the door and that cutting prices periodically is a good way to do that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;&amp;quot;These chips will eventually go away in the next few quarters or even in a few years in some cases, but Intel wants to keep them moving out the door right up until they&amp;#39;re discontinued,&amp;quot; he added. &amp;quot;They&amp;#39;re going to be bringing out new designs. Then they&amp;#39;ve got to look at their older stuff. The new stuff is faster and better, so you have to cut prices on the old stuff to keep it moving.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Linux set to make mobile splash</title>
      <link>http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/redirect?source=rss&amp;url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/07/21/Linux-set-to-make-mobile-splash_1.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="rxbodyfield"&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;Linux is set to make a major impact in the mobile computing realm, the executive director of the Linux Foundation stressed at a conference Monday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="right"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ad.doubleclick.net/jump/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;skey=patch_management;pkey=security;ord=123456789?" target="_blank" /&gt;&lt;img src="http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;skey=patch_management;pkey=security;ord=123456789?" width="336" height="280" border="0" alt="" align="right"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;Speaking at the Open Mobile Exchange portion of the O'Reilly Open Source Conference (OSCON) in Portland, Ore., &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/03/12/Linux-Foundation-Wed-love-to-work-with-Microsoft_1.html" class="regularArticleU"&gt;Jim Zemlin&lt;/a&gt;, executive director of the foundation, touted the trends and technologies pushing Linux into a leadership position in mobile systems. He was followed by Jason Grigsby, Web strategist at mobile and Web design firm Cloud Four, who emphasized the coming influence of the mobile Web but countered that developers are not yet ready for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;Zemlin said Linux has emerged as a primary platform, even on the desktop. Meanwhile, it also has spread to devices such as gas pumps and medical equipment. Additionally, it is being deployed in Wall Street trading, in consumer electronics, and on Mars in space-based equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;"It?s clear that Linux is going to be a leader in the mobile space," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;Linux, according to Zemlin, offers a unified product platform, flexibility, and a software stack. It also has experienced an increase in the volume of software content, with the lines of Linux handset code doubling every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;"Really, what's happening in mobile is instead of having a hardware-up approach, you're starting to see a software-down approach," with the software experience driving the mobile marketplace, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;By supporting Linux, developers do not have to contend with compatibility issues of supporting different platforms. The industry wants to get away from that, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;"It's just a nightmare to support all these different OSes and try to maintain some degree of compatibilty," Zemlin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;Different middleware packages and application development frameworks are available for Linux. "There's a huge freedom to mix the core Linux kernel," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;Business drivers for Linux include reduced deployment costs, room to differentiate, and an ecosystem of development around phone platforms. "It's obviously a royalty-free platform. That's a huge business driver," said Zemlin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;"Linux really allows device manufacturers and new people to come in and create their own brand," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="1"&gt;Symbian's move to open source has had a negative impact on Windows, leaving it the only royalty-based mobile platform, said Zemlin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="2"&gt;Linux application development is starting to coalesce around initiatives such as &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/archives/t.jsp?N=s&amp;amp;V=93157" class="regularArticleU"&gt;Google's Android&lt;/a&gt; and LiMo (Linux Mobile Foundation), he said. Other Linux efforts are afoot such as Openmmoko, to create a smartphone platform, and Ubuntu Mobile, said Zemlin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="2"&gt;&lt;b&gt;[ For&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;the full lowdown on &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/archives/t.jsp?N=s&amp;amp;V=93157&amp;amp;source=fssr" class="regularArticleU"&gt;Google's Android mobile development platform&lt;/a&gt;, see InfoWorld's special report ]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="2"&gt;"There really isn't any major player from a corporate point of view who doesn?t have their foot in some way in the Linux camp," other than Microsoft, said Zemlin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="2"&gt;Other efforts involve development of &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/03/31/The-low-cost-laptop-offer-Microsoft-cant-refuse_1.html" class="regularArticleU"&gt;Linux mobile devices such as notebook systems&lt;/a&gt;. "You're going to see 50 of those companies launch next year," Zemlin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="2"&gt;Grigsby, meanwhile, emphasized that the mobile Web is coming, but Web developers are not ready yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="2"&gt;There are 3.3 billion mobile devices on the planet, he said. "That's one for every two people," and more than the number of PCs, cars, televisions, and credit cards, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="2"&gt;He lauded the capabilities of &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/archives/t.jsp?N=s&amp;amp;V=95808" class="regularArticleU"&gt;Apple's iPhone&lt;/a&gt; and what it has done for mobile computing. "The iPhone is really the Mosaic of the mobile Web," opening people's eyes to opportunities on the mobile side the way Mosaic did with browsers, Grigsby said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="2"&gt;&lt;b&gt;[ See&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/archives/t.jsp?N=s&amp;amp;V=95808&amp;amp;source=fssr" class="regularArticleU"&gt;InfoWorld's full coverage of the iPhone,&lt;/a&gt; including enterprise strategies and security issues, in our special report ]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="2"&gt;But the mobile Web is being held back by UI issues and access to the device characteristics on the phone. Standards and performance also are issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="2"&gt;Grigsby predicted more fracturing, proprietary extensions, and a return to the browsers wars on the device side. There are many different browsers, he said. A lot of mobile browsers are designed around WAP (Wireless Application Protocol) rather than featuring full desktop rendering technology such as JavaScript, Grigsby said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="2"&gt;Web developers, he said, have become bandwidth gluttons, spoiled by high-speed broadband connections they won't have on mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="2"&gt;In other developments at OSCON:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="2"&gt;* Microsoft later this week plans to discuss plans for the upcoming &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/05/30/Microsoft-linking-Silverlight-Ruby-on-Rails_1.html" class="regularArticleU"&gt;IronRuby&lt;/a&gt; 1.0, which is a version of the Ruby programming language compatible with the .Net software development platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="2"&gt;* Canonical officials said they would introduce version 2.0 of the Launchpad hosting platform for software development projects. The 2.0 version includes a beta Internet services API enabling external applications to authenticate, query, and modify data stored in the Launchpad database programmatically. The Bazaar distributed version control system featured in Launchpad has been enhanced to improve handling of larger code bases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBody" page="2"&gt;* The makers of Icecore, which is an open source collaboration platform, are changing the name of the technology to Kablink and adding functionality for workflow. The name change was inspired by the addition of workflow and also is intended to avoid confusion with first-generation technologies, the company said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Open-source software a security risk, study claims</title>

      <description>&lt;div class="rxbodyfield"&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/2008/053008-survey-open-source-is-entering.html"&gt;Open-source software&lt;/a&gt; is a significant security risk for corporations that use it because in many cases, the open source community fails to adhere to minimal &lt;a href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/2008/053008-survey-open-source-is-entering.html"&gt;security&lt;/a&gt; best practices, according a study released Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="right"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ad.doubleclick.net/jump/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;skey=patch_management;pkey=security;ord=123456789?" target="_blank" /&gt;&lt;img src="http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;skey=patch_management;pkey=security;ord=123456789?" width="336" height="280" border="0" alt="" align="right"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;The study, carried out by Fortify Software with help from consultant Larry Suto, evaluated 11 open-source &lt;a href="http://www.networkworld.com/topics/software.html"&gt;software&lt;/a&gt; packages and each community&amp;#39;s response to security issues over the course of about three months. The goal was to find out if the community for each open-source software package was responsive to security questions or vulnerability findings, published security guidelines, and maintained a secure development process, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;&lt;b&gt;[ Track the latest trends in open source with InfoWorld&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/openresource/?source=fssr"&gt;Open Sources blog&lt;/a&gt;. ]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;Open source application server Tomcat scored the best in the study, titled &amp;quot;Open Source Study -- How Are Open Source Development Communities Embracing Security Best Practices?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;The remaining 10 open-source application, tool and database packages -- Derby, Geronimo, Hibernate, Hipergate, JBoss, Jonas, OFBiz, OpenCMS, Resin, and Struts -- had a dismal showing. Among these 10 packages, application server JBoss scored higher by providing a prominent link to security information on its Web site and easy access to security experts, but came up short for not having a specific e-mail alias for submission of security vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;&amp;quot;You don&amp;#39;t want to report bugs to a general mailing list because it would go to the general public,&amp;quot; says Jacob West, manager of Fortify&amp;#39;s security research group. There needs to be a measure of confidentiality in reporting bugs so that the fix for them can be provided when the public is notified, so attackers don&amp;#39;t get early information they can exploit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;But too often the open-source communities that offer their software for free don&amp;#39;t appear to be as mindful about security practices as their commercial counterparts, which charge for software and support, West says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;Fortify identified a total of 22,826 cross-site scripting and 15,612 SQL injection issues associated with multiple versions of the 11 open-source software packages examined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;But when Fortify tried to reach out to the open-source software communities, with the primary point of contact a Web site and a general e-mail address, the security firm found that &amp;quot;in two-thirds of these cases, you didn&amp;#39;t get a response at all,&amp;quot; West says. &amp;quot;There are no phone numbers. Who do you go to ask for information? It&amp;#39;s kind of hard to tell who these people are.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;The report itself notes, &amp;quot;Open-source packages often claim enterprise-class capabilities but are not adopting -- or even considering -- industry best practices. Only a few open source development teams are moving in the right direction.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;West says Fortify did not conduct this study in order to condemn open source software, but rather to point out that the security practices need to improve because open source adoption by enterprises and governments is growing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;Howard Schmidt, former White House cybersecurity czar who&amp;#39;s now a consultant, and also a board member at Fortify, says the study shows that when it comes to business adoption of open source software, &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;ve got to go into this with your eyes wide open.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;The reality is that while open source software may appear more cost-effective and just as functional as commercial software in some instances, the &lt;a href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/2008/070908-developing-open-source-business-policies-that.html"&gt;question of maintenance&lt;/a&gt; must be examined very carefully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;&amp;quot;Who do you reach out to?&amp;quot; Schmidt asks. &amp;quot;What about the thousands of companies out there running Geronimo? And what about your supply-chain partners?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;The bottom line is that corporations may find they have to undertake remediation of open source packages on their own. &amp;quot;You are effectively on your own, absent your having an arrangement ahead of time,&amp;quot; Schmidt says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;Government agencies and corporations need to decide if they&amp;#39;re going to try to mitigate problems with open source software themselves, through risk assessment and code review, and whether they plan to give that information back to the open source community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;This is a fundamental question about the life-cycle development of the software, West says, adding that the study indicated to Fortify that the open source communities in these cases tended not to correct for identified flaws in software versions over a period of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Update: SAP will shut TomorrowNow at the end of October</title>
      <link>http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/redirect?source=rss&amp;url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/07/21/SAP_will_shut_TomorrowNow_subsidiary_1.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="rxbodyfield"&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;SAP plans to close its TomorrowNow software maintenance subsidiary by Oct. 31, having failed to find a buyer for the company. It will help TomorrowNow&amp;#39;s 225 customers to find new support providers before the company closes its doors, it announced Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="right"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ad.doubleclick.net/jump/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;skey=patch_management;pkey=security;ord=123456789?" target="_blank" /&gt;&lt;img src="http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;skey=patch_management;pkey=security;ord=123456789?" width="336" height="280" border="0" alt="" align="right"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;TomorrowNow built a business selling third-party support for PeopleSoft and JD Edwards applications at around half the price charged by the original software vendors, later&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/05/12/78268_HNsapsupportsiebel_1.html"&gt;adding support for Siebel&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;and Baan software to its range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;&lt;b&gt;[ Discover the top-rated IT products as rated by the &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/testcenter/?source=fssr"&gt;InfoWorld Test Center&lt;/a&gt;. ]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;SAP bought TomorrowNow in February 2005: the company offered a convenient way for SAP to get closer to customers of its arch-rival Oracle, which had acquired PeopleSoft and JD Edwards in 2004, and later snapped up Siebel too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;However, in March 2007&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/07/03/22/HNoraclesuessap_1.html"&gt;Oracle filed suit against TomorrowNow and SAP&lt;/a&gt;, alleging that they had gotten a little too close. Oracle charged that TomorrowNow employees had illegally downloaded support materials for PeopleSoft and JD Edwards products from an Oracle Web site. SAP has denied gaining access to Oracle&amp;#39;s intellectual property in this way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;Last November, SAP announced the&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/07/11/19/TomorrowNow-CEO-resigns-SAP-might-sell_1.html"&gt;resignation of TomorrowNow&amp;#39;s management team&lt;/a&gt;, and said it was considering selling the company. Both moves were seen as ways for SAP to distance itself from the activities of its subsidiary and clean up its reputation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;In the end, arranging a sale proved too much of a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;&amp;quot;We carefully considered many options for selling TomorrowNow, but it would have been an extremely complex transaction for both the seller and the buyer. We chose to wind down operations instead,&amp;quot; said SAP spokesman Saswato Das.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;Oracle is asking for damages likely to total US$1 billion or more in its suit, according to documents filed with the court last month. A trial is scheduled for February 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;Das would not comment on what effect the closure of TomorrowNow might have on the case. SAP expects the cost of winding down operations at TomorrowNow to be &amp;quot;immaterial,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;SAP aims to make the switch in support provider as smooth as possible for TomorrowNow&amp;#39;s 225 customers, around 70 of whom are also direct customers of SAP, Das said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;&amp;quot;We are working with each customer individually to help them choose their best option, including choosing Oracle support. Some can go to other third-party support,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;Despite abandoning the market, SAP still sees a role for third-party software support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;&amp;quot;We believe the third-party maintenance market has its strongest appeal to customers using software that is considered end-of-life or obsolete, which does not apply to the bulk of SAP software,&amp;quot; he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>iPhone 3G availability plummets</title>

      <description>&lt;div class="rxbodyfield"&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;Apple&amp;#39;s iPhone 3G supply dropped dramatically over the weekend, as the company&amp;#39;s own inventory tool showed fewer than 9 percent of its stores had any phones to sell on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="right"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ad.doubleclick.net/jump/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;skey=patch_management;pkey=security;ord=123456789?" target="_blank" /&gt;&lt;img src="http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;skey=patch_management;pkey=security;ord=123456789?" width="336" height="280" border="0" alt="" align="right"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;As of 11 a.m. Eastern time, only 16 of Apple&amp;#39;s U.S. retail stores, or 8.5 percent of the 188 total stores, listed iPhone 3Gs available. That figure is significantly down from Thursday, when 50 stores, or 27 percent, indicated that they had iPhones in stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;&lt;b&gt;[ For the big picture on the &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/archives/t.jsp?N=s&amp;amp;V=103333&amp;amp;source=fssr"&gt;iPhone 3G&lt;/a&gt;, see InfoWorld&amp;#39;s special report, and for more on bringing the iPhone into the office, read &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/06/10/24FE-iphone-2-at-work_1.html"&gt;How to make the new iPhone work at work&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;quot; And get the latest on mobile developments with InfoWorld&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/newsletter/subscribe.html?source=fssr"&gt;Mobile Report newsletter&lt;/a&gt;. ]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;And unlike last week, when as many as 13 stores said that they had all three iPhone 3G models for sale -- the 8GB version in black, and the 16GB version in both white and black -- by Sunday, no Apple store had all in inventory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;Even one of Apple&amp;#39;s most prominent stores (and the only one open around the clock), located on 5th Avenue in New York City, didn&amp;#39;t have a full complement of iPhones to sell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;In fact, according to &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.apple.com/retail/iphone/availability.html"&gt;Apple&amp;#39;s own stock-checking tool&lt;/a&gt;, none of the 38 stores in California, Apple&amp;#39;s home state, had iPhones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;The hardest-to-find iPhone 3G remained the $299 black 16GB model, which was available today in only 3 stores, or 1.6 percent, of the outlets. Supplies of the $199 8GB iPhone 3G and the $299 16GB white model have also plummeted since last week, according to Apple. Only 10 stores reported the 8GB as available on Sunday (5.3 percent of the U.S. stores) compared to 24 stores on Thursday (12.8 percent), while just 6 stores claimed that the 16GB white iPhone 3G was in stock (3.2 percent), down from the 46 stores (24.5 percent) that had it Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;It could be weeks before the deficit improves, one Wall Street analyst said last week. Gene Munster, an analyst with Piper Jaffray &amp;amp; Co., said in a Thursday interview that it would take Apple &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;amp;articleId=9110259"&gt;two to four weeks&lt;/a&gt; to place orders with its suppliers, receive more iPhones, and restock the depleted inventory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&amp;#39;s 1,200 retail stores, meanwhile, were almost completely out of iPhone inventory as early as last Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;However, some customers contributing to a &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://forums.wireless.att.com/cng/board/message?board.id=apple&amp;amp;thread.id=31997"&gt;massive thread on AT&amp;amp;T&amp;#39;s support forum&lt;/a&gt; -- by Sunday, it had collected more than 3,900 messages -- said that they had been told iPhones they ordered on July 11 or 12 using the mobile operator&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;direct fulfillment&amp;quot; program had been shipped as of Friday, July 18 or Saturday, July 19. A few consumers said they had actually received iPhones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&amp;#39;s direct fulfillment program lets customers place orders at one the company&amp;#39;s retail stores; the store notifies the customer when the iPhone 3G has arrived, at which time the customers must return to the store to pick up and activate the phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p page="1" class="ArticleBody"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.computerworld.com/index.jsp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Computerworld&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#160;is an InfoWorld affiliate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://a.img-dpreview.com/news/0809/nikon_50_sm.gif" width="100" height="99" hspace="8" align="right"">]]>Pre-Photokina 2008: Nikon has today announced a new standard prime lens, the AF-S Nikkor 50mm F1.4G. Headlining the new features is a built-in Silent Wave Motor which enables autofocus with the D60/D40x/D40 DSLRs, but the lens also boasts a brand-new optical system with 8 elements in 7 groups for improved image quality, a circular aperture diaphragm for more attractive background blur, and a barrel design which does not change length on focusing. The lens will be available from December 2008.</description>

<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://a.img-dpreview.com/news/0809/vincentlaforet-front.jpg" width="140" height="79" hspace="8" align="right"">]]>Renowned (Pulitzer Prize-winning) photographer Vincent Laforet managed to get his hands on a Canon EOS 5D Mark II and seems to be pretty impressed with the results, &amp;quot;...what you can see with your eye in the worst light (such as sodium-vapor street lights at 3 a.m. in Brooklyn) - this camera can capture it with ease.&amp;quot; However he seems even more impressed with the Mark II&apos;s video capture, &amp;quot;It produces the best video in low light that I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen - at 1080p&amp;quot;. There are a few downsampled images on his site but perhaps of more interest to many is the fact that Vincent is planning to publish a video produced using the 5D Mark II, we&apos;ll update this article once it&apos;s live.</description>

All samples are provided as JPEG straight from the camera (we don&apos;t currently have any RAW conversion software which supports the EOS 5D Mark II). Enjoy!</description>

Phil has dragged himself out of the server room, dusted himself off and has had the entire dpreview staff furiously scouring the spec tables and delving through the menus to help get behind those headlines. And here is the result - our hands-on preview of the Canon EOS 5D Mark II.</description>

A letter from SanDisk&apos;s Chairman and CEO to Samsung says the board considers the offer from the World&apos;s second-largest chip maker to undervalue its business. SanDisk announced, on September 5th, it had held talks with Samsung but described the latest offer as &apos;unsolicited&apos; and &apos;opportunistically timed.&apos; The offer would value the California, US-headquartered flash card maker at $5.8bn and would help Samsung reduce the technology licence fees it currently pays to SanDisk.</description>

UPDATE: While we haven&apos;t heard this officially from Canon it does appear that the new CMOS SX1 IS won&apos;t be available in North America.</description>

<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://a.img-dpreview.com/reviews/images/panasonic_dmcg1.gif" width="120" height="91" hspace="8" align="right"">]]>Pre-Photokina: Panasonic has unveiled what it is calling the World&amp;rsquo;s First Full-time Live View Digital Interchangeable Lens Camera - the Lumix DMC-G1. Utilizing the Micro Four Thirds standard announced last month, the G1 drops the mirror / prism optical viewfinder that has been standard in SLR cameras for over half a century in favor of a newly developed high resolution electronic viewfinder. Squeezed into the diminutive body are a new 12MP Four Thirds Live MOS sensor with SSWF, new processor (Venus Engine HD) and a comprehensive combination of DLSR and compact camera features (though surprisingly, no movie mode). We&apos;ve had a prototype G1 in the office for a week or so and have produced a detailed hands-on preview to whet your appetite whilst we wait for reviewable sample.</description>

Featuring the 24.6 MP CMOS sensor announced in January, the Alpha 900 offers several enticing features, including sensor-shift image stabilization, a super 100% coverage viewfinder and the same high resolution screen as the Alpha 700 (the new model also inherits most of the 700&apos;s features, menus and external controls). We&apos;ve had an Alpha 900 for a few days now, just enough time to produce a detailed hands-on preview and a quick gallery of sample images.</description>

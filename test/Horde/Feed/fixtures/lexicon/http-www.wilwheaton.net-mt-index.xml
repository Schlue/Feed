<blockquote>
  <p>I was one of the earliest Mac adopters. I had a Mac 128K in the first few months of its release. [. . .] I loved that computer. It was portable, which is funny to say now, because it only weighed like, 20-30 pounds. It had a handle on the top, so clearly, it was portable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I don't ever want to lose the experience of going to the comic shop on Wednesday and walking around -- even if I'm only there to get two books. Spending 40 minutes looking at everything and talking to the other geeks that are there and having the owner of the comic shop say, "I know you normally don't read this, but based on the years of you coming here I think you'd like it," I really like that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>CMix:</strong> Do you read any of the Star Trek comics at all?</p>

  <p><strong>WW:</strong> No.<br></p>

  <p><strong>CMix:</strong> No desire to or you just don't care?<br></p>

  <p><strong>WW:</strong> It's not that I have no desire. It's not that I don't care. It's that I have a limited amount of time and I have to choose really carefully where I invest that time. If I'm forced to choose between a Star Trek comic or Criminal, I just enjoy Criminal more, so...<br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Um. In other words, I have no desire and I don't care, I guess. That sounds really harsh, but . . . well, I just don't know how to finish that without feeling like a dick. I guess that I like <em>Star Trek</em> a lot, but not enough to read the novels and comic books.<br></p>
<p>. . . yep, feeling like a dick right now.</p>
<p>Point of clarification: In the interview, I say <em>"I've been reading Batman since Grant Morrison started working on it, because there are a few guys in the world that I'll read anything by. Grant Morrison does Teletubbies, I'm there."</em> This makes it sound like I <em>started</em> reading Batman when Grant Morrison's run began, but I've actually been reading Batman since around 1987 or 1988.</p>

Hey, check it out! I found a tube that goes right into the studio, so I can ride the Internets while I'm between scenes!</p>

<p>Today is the day I've been waiting for since I booked this job. Today is the day that I get to really tear into this character, and mainline the good stuff that keeps actors coming back for more, chasing the dramatic dragon until we die. I was so excited to work today, I hardly slept at all last night, and woke up this morning before my alarm went off. I haven't felt like this since I was a little kid at Christmas. </p>

<p>God, I miss this. I didn't know how much I missed it until last week, but holy shit do I miss this. This cast, this crew, these writers, this director, this whole show is just incredible. I'm truly lucky to be here, and I'm so grateful that I can appreciate it, and not take it for granted like I would have ten years ago. </p>

<p>I wish I could say more about today's work. I wish I could identify and compliment the incredible actors I'm working with. I wish I could go into great detail about why I'm so excited to do what I'm doing today, but it'll have to wait until this episode airs in October. </p>

<p>I'll never stop writing, but I can't deny that there's a part of me who will always be an actor, and I owe it all to the people I've worked with on this show. </p>

<p><em>I thought I was out, but they pulled me back in!</em></p>

I got home at 4 this morning, didn't fall asleep until 5, and then had to explain to my dogs that, no, just because I was in bed and the sun was coming up, I'm not interested in getting up to do stuff with them.</p>
<p>So I only got to sleep for seven disturbed hours, and I feel like I'm on the road to Bat Country right now. Luckily for me, I don't go to set until 5:30 tonight, and I don't have any dialog today.</p>
<p>Despite the havoc the last few days have unleashed on my body (which is very confused by the hours I'm forcing it to keep, and [spoiler]) I have loved every second of the experience.</p>
<p>I'm keeping a production diary, which I can't release until my episode airs in October, but I can safely say that working on this show, with this cast and crew, creating this character, has reawakened my slumbering love of acting. I'll have more to say about that when I can really analyze how I feel about it and why. (short short version: I miss the camaraderie of being in a cast, and I'd forgotten how good it feels to discover interesting moments with the director, writers, and other actors. I work best while collaborating, it seems.)</p>
<p>Anyway, I feel so blurry that the doll's trying to kill me and the toaster's laughing at me, so I'm going to sign off. But before I do, a couple of things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I missed the Watchmen trailer. It was up and then down while I was at work. Dang. Oh! Wait, there it is on iTunes. Wow, that was awesome.</li>

  <li style="list-style: none"><br></li>

  <li>I am too tired to see <em>Dark Kinght</em> (I didn't correct that, because it illustrates exactly how tired I am. Yes, I misspelled the title of the freakin' Batman movie I've been waiting my whole life to see. Jeebus) today, and probably won't get to see it and the Watchmen trailer until next week, right before Comic-Con.</li>

  <li style="list-style: none"><br></li>

  <li>I did <em>not</em> miss <a href="http://www.drhorrible.com/">Doctor Horrible's Sing Along Blog</a>, and neither should you. It's absolutely magnificent, the whole cast is outstanding, and my fellow ACME alum Felicia Day is sensational. I want the soundtrack, and I want it NOW! <a href="http://www.nickerblog.com/">Shane Nickerson</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/shanen/statuses/861310168">said</a> that it's probably the best thing he's ever seen that was made for the Internet, and better than most sitcoms. I totally agree, and wish Shane would stop saying these things before I get a chance to say them.</li>

  <li style="list-style: none"><br></li>

  <li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/wheatonbooks/pool/">Wheaton's Books in the Wild</a> at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> has 77 members and 48 supermegaawesome contributions. Yay!</li>

  <li style="list-style: none"><br></li>

  <li>This is a reminder to everyone who has tickets that <a href="http://wilwheaton.typepad.com/wwdnbackup/2008/07/it-turns-out-th.html">I will be at Comic-Con</a> from Thursday until Saturday of next week. I'm probably going to sell out the second printing of <em><a href="http://www.monolithpress.com/projects.php?projectID=5" title="The Happiest Days of Our Lives by Wil Wheaton">Happiest Days</a></em> while I'm there. I'll be with my friend <a href="http://www.dieselsweeties.com/blog/?p=348">Rich Stevens at the Dumbrella booth</a>, which is number 1335. MC Frontalot is going to be there, too, so if you're looking to fill that final square on Nerd Bingo, come and see us.</li>

  <li style="list-style: none"><br></li>

  <li>On Thursday, I'll be on a panel called <strong>Star Trek Without a Blueprint: How books and comics keep expanding the boundaries of the Star Trek universe.</strong> We'll be talking about the future of Star Trek publishing in room 32AB from 4:00-5:00. I'll be on the panel with Andy Mangels (moderator and Star Trek author), Margaret Clark (executive editor, Pocket Books), Andy Schmidt (senior editor, IDW) and Star Trek authors Kevin Dilmore, Dave Mack, Scott Tipton, and Dayton Ward.</li>

  <li style="list-style: none"><br></li>

  <li>Finally, TrekMovie has the <a href="http://trekmovie.com/2008/07/17/preview-of-star-trek-comic-posters-with-first-cast-photos/#more-2175" title="Star Trek 2008 Movie Poster with Cast Photos">poster</a> we've all been waiting to see. It looks awesome.</li>
</ul>
<p>Have a great weekend, everyone!</p>

Tomorrow, I start work on the show.</p>
<p>The script's been rewritten a few times since I first read it, and I've been able to read each draft in its entirety, which has been really interesting to me as a writer, as I track the changes and try to figure out what network and studio notes they were intended to address. It's got to be so difficult for these writers to take a certain scene or character in one direction, write really great dialog and stuff to get them there, and then be told that they have to throw it all away and take things in a different direction. And do that three times in five days. I honestly don't know how they do it.</p>
<p>People ask me all the time if I'm working on a screen play, or if I'm interested in writing for television. In fact, a staff writer from a show we all watch told me last year that I'd fit right in on that show, and that I should think about taking my writing career in that direction.</p>
<p>I said thanks, but no.* I know how hard it is to write a good story with compelling characters and an engaging plot. I also know how arbitrary and soul crushing the entertainment industry is, and that's just as an actor. The people who write for television are basically writing the equivalent of thirteen features a season, serving several different masters, including the show's producers and the people at the network. For a fascinating insider's view of this process, you <em>must</em> read <a href="http://kfmonkey.blogspot.com/">John Rogers</a>' posts about his show <em>Leverage</em>:<br></p>

<p>I had a hard enough time coming up with something clever to write every week for <a href="http://www.avclub.com/content/gool">Games of Our Lives</a> and <a href="http://wilwheaton.typepad.com/wwdnbackup/2007/07/geek-in-review-.html">Geek in Review</a>, and in both of those cases, I only had to make one editor happy. I don't even want to think about what it's really like to make a whole bunch of different people happy, especially when all of those people work in the entertainment industry, and there are millions of dollars at stake. I have nothing but respect for the people who can do it.</p>
<p>Anyway, this post is about changing gears, so I suppose I should get to that.</p>
<p>When I went for my Criminal Minds table read last week, one of the writers introduced herself to me and offered to answer any questions I had about the character and script. My first instinct was to ask if I could some sit in the writer's room and take notes, but before I could jam my foot in my mouth, I reminded myself, "You're here as an actor. Do your job." It was then that I realized I'd have to switch gears before I started work on this show. I'd have to take off my rookie writer's pants, and put on my veteran actor's pants for a week. That sounds simple and logical, but it's been tough, especially because I was really building momentum on these short stories I've been writing. I guess it's a good problem to have, though, so I'm not complaining.</p>
<p>This week and last week have been weird for me, because though I don't think of myself as a full-time actor any more, I can't deny that I'm super excited to bring this character to life, and I'm proud of myself for booking the job. Allow me to quote <a href="http://nickerblog.com/">Shane Nickerson:</a> <em>"There's something to be said for not needing it and not seeking it, isn't there? I won't say not wanting it, because I am too keenly aware that no matter how much we try to convince ourselves otherwise, we actors may never stop wanting it, somewhere deep inside."</em> That is 100% true, and I'm not even going to try to deny it. As much as I hate dragging my ass all over town for auditions, and as frustrating and demoralizing as the whole process is, when I'm actually working with other actors and creative people to take words on a page and bring them to life, it's almost worth it.</p>
<p><em>Almost</em>. Which is why I've mostly traded taking the words off the page for putting them on it.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I tried to spend the day writing. For eight hours, I did everything I could to knock ideas out of my head and give my characters interesting things to say and do. I failed in every attempt at masonry, growing more and more frustrated with each highlight and delete. Finally, I accepted that my internal creative CPU wants and needs to be doing actor things, like breaking down scenes, developing and understanding this character, and learning my lines. Luckily, I've done this long enough that it's all second nature, and it's all deeply satisfying, so it doesn't feel like work at all.</p>
<p>You know, it feels strange, but also good to change gears for a few days. Hopefully, I won't grind them too much.</p>
<p><em>*There's been a lot of confusion about this, and I want to clarify: I wasn't offered any jobs on any shows. I was told by an experienced writer that, in that writer's opinion, I would be able do it if I wanted to, and I said I wasn't interested in that kind of thing, because I don't believe I have what it takes.</em></p>

<p>But I'm not so good at taking this particular bit of my own advice. My sense of responsibility to my family, and the uncertain economy we find ourselves living in right now forces me to keep my head down and stay focused on whatever the next thing is. This keeps me motivated, but it doesn't leave a lot of room to just sit back and enjoy things, which is something I think I need to do a little more often, especially on a day like today where I just feel . . . stabby.</p>

<p>It's easy for me to lose sight of the thousands of copies of <a href="http://www.monolithpress.com/projects.php?projectID=5"><em>Happiest Days</em></a> that have made the journey from my office, through my living room, and into the hands of real people all over the world, but in an effort to enjoy the good things a little bit, I present this photo of <a href="http://www.monolithpress.com/projects.php?projectID=5"><em>The Happiest Days of Our Lives</em></a>, keeping some very good company, <a href="http://marriedtothemd.blogspot.com/2008/07/pictures-worth-thousand-words.html">on vacation</a>. </p>

</p>

<p>It made me really happy to see this picture, for a lot of reasons that I can't detail without feeling like a jerk, so I'll just say thank you to WWdN and HDoOL reader <a href="http://marriedtothemd.blogspot.com">Amanda C.</a> for sharing a little bit of her vacation with me, and allowing me to share it with you.</p>

We talked for about two hours, and he ended up with a transcript that's so long, they're splitting the interview into three parts.<br></p>
<p><a href="http://www.comicmix.com/news/2008/07/14/interview-wil-wheaton-on-writing-movies-and-comics-part-1/" title="Wil Wheaton talks about writing, comics, and movies with ComicMix">Part one</a> is up today, and rather than excerpt it heavily, I'll just quote my favorite bit:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>[TokyoPop] asked me if I would write a <em>Next Generation</em> Manga, and would I write a Wesley Crusher story, and I didn't want to do it because it felt to me like there was no way in that equation that I could return a positive result.</p>

  <p>Ultimately, I'm just not interested in Wesley Crusher anymore. It's been a long time and he's sort of frozen in amber in a certain state. I don't have anything to add to that. I don't have anything new to bring to it at all.</p>

  <p><strong>CMix:</strong> No thoughts about killing him off?</p>

  <p><strong>WW:</strong> No. I'm way more interested in working on my own original stuff. And there's a finite number of time/energy/creative units that I can gather on my "collect resources" turn. I would rather put those into building my own story than into repairing the Wesley Crusher building.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are times in my life when I wonder if I spend a little too much time gaming. I frequently decide that there's just no such thing as too much gaming . . . then I read something like this, a faithful recreation of my actual thought process, and I think I should just step away from the bag of dice for a few turns.</p>
<p>Wait. Not turns. Days. I meant to say days.</p>
<p>Sigh.<br></p>

<p>A few bits of junk sneak through, but it's probably one every two or three days, instead of several daily offers for luxury Rolex watches at 80% off, or various ways to take advantage of the ATTRACTIVE PRICE on Cializ and Viagre, so she won't laugh at my noodle every day.</p>
<p>Recently, however, this managed to evade the filters:<br></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><span style="font-family: Optima; font-size: 14px;">mort You computer was infected by our software!<br>
  If you will not buy our software - you will bee lost all data on your PC!</span><br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It closes with a URL to purchase the software, presumably so the e-mail's recipient can respond to the comical extortion attempt.</p>
<p>I laughed when I read it. I mean, it's obviously a load, so I junked it and went on with my day. I kept thinking about it, though: an intelligent person will see right through this and junk it. I've already updated my corpus to catch future attempts to convince me I "will bee lost all data" on my PC. But the spammer isn't looking to ensnare an intelligent person; the spammer is looking to ensnare exactly the kind of person who reads the e-mail, and sees it as a serious threat.</p>
<p>"This was clearly written by an idiot," the victim would think. Then, after a moment's consideration: "But what if he's serious?! I don't want to bee lost all data on my PC! I'd better do what he says!" <em>Click. Boom.</em></p>
<p>There are a lot of us who have been online since the Internet was a series of networked BBSes. Some of us remember closed systems like Compuserve and GEnie. We remember what it was like to wait twenty minutes to download a GIF at 28.8, and how magnificent it was to see a weather satellite image on a university's T1-connected computer.</p>
<p>We see through these scams because we pre-date the scammers, but there are lots of people -- and I'm not just talking about our parents and grandparents -- who just don't know any better. They run unpatched machines, leave their routers set to their default passwords, and are prime phishing targets, simply because this technology is, to them, indistinguishable from magic.</p>
<p>As the Internet becomes a more integral part of everyone's lives, we're going to encounter more and more people who don't understand its inner workings any more than I understand how to take apart my car's diesel engine for fun and profit. I believe that we have a responsibility to these people, to help educate and enlighten them, so they understand how to protect themselves online.</p>
<p>Think of this another way: if we don't help people understand how to protect themselves from spammers and phishers, how can we expect them to understand the importance of network neutrality?</p>

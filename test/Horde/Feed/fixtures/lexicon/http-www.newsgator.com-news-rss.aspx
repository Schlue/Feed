&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;Olympics Widgets Provide Media Companies With Advertising Revenue &amp; Complimentary Premium Content&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Denver, Colo. — July 9, 2008 — &lt;/STRONG&gt;NewsGator Technologies Inc. today announced a partnership with Agence France-Presse (AFP) to provide widgets featuring Olympics news and event coverage to media sites at no charge. With this program, media companies receive complimentary access to premium AFP content prepackaged in branded and engaging widgets that they can add to their Web site. The Olympics widgets are supported by advertising and approved distribution partners are eligible to receive a portion of the advertising revenue generated by the widgets. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;NewsGator-hosted AFP widgets feature popular Olympics content including a countdown to the Games, event news and results, sports animations, videos, photos, quizzes and more. Each widget includes the media company’s logo and links to Olympics-related articles and content. The Olympic content is provided by AFP and actually resides on the media company’s Web site. A media company simply places the widgets on their site. Readers can then view the widgets and port them to their favorite Web location. Every time a reader clicks on one of the widget links they are directed back to the media company’s Web site where the full content is displayed on Web pages that can be monetized with ads.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;"With NewsGator’s innovative syndication model, we are extending our brand and content not only to social networking sites but also to major media sites," said Gilles Tarot, sales &amp; marketing director for AFP North America. "The result is significantly greater exposure and increased online ad revenue for our media partners."&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;"AFP is offering media companies a truly unique opportunity with access to premium content that is in high demand," said Jeff Nolan, vice president, NewsGator Consumer and Media Services. "According to Sports Marketing Surveys, 203 million people in North America alone watched the 2004 Athens Games and significant growth in viewership is expected for the 2008 Beijing Games. We are helping our distribution partners generate revenue off this program and that’s a big deal for media companies - premium content in a widget package that features their own branding and we guarantee they generate revenue."&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;BOSTON, Enterprise 2.0 Conference — June 9, 2008 —&lt;/STRONG&gt; NewsGator Technologies, Inc. announced today that Universal McCann, a global media communications agency, is deploying a full-service internal social computing platform based on NewsGator Social Sites and Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007. The project’s mission is to take advantage of innovative Enterprise 2.0 technologies to greatly improve communication and the flow of information across Universal McCann’s 90 offices in 66 countries. Working jointly with Microsoft and NewsGator, Universal McCann has implemented a secure social networking solution that improves productivity by allowing employees to better communicate and collaborate. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;“The fast-changing media environment in which Universal McCann works demands that our employees have a finger on the pulse of what’s going on, not just in their respective markets and account groups, but globally across the industry,” said Quentin George, worldwide officer for digital strategy &amp;amp; market innovation for Universal McCann.&amp;nbsp; “In order to deliver our clients the ‘Next Thing Now’ we must share and learn from our collective knowledge and experience.&amp;nbsp; We found NewsGator and Microsoft’s social networking tools to be the ideal way to facilitate communication and knowledge sharing across geographic and division boundaries – leading to improved productivity and increased innovation.”&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;“We considered a variety of social computing solutions, including consumer-based social networking products, but they fell short on business-specific features, internal systems integration, and security capabilities,” said Jason Harrison, worldwide chief information officer for Universal McCann. “Microsoft and NewsGator offered us an enterprise-class social computing solution that delivers the social networking features we need today while providing us with a platform that can easily evolve as our needs grow and change.&amp;nbsp; In addition, their solution integrates seamlessly with our technology infrastructure and security protocols, helping to lower our support costs.”&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;The combined Social Sites and Office SharePoint Server 2007 solution provides Universal McCann with an online destination that facilitates collaboration and content sharing across the global Universal McCann network.&amp;nbsp; The social computing platform integrates Web 2.0 concepts such as social networking, communities, RSS, and blogging in an intuitive, easy-to-use interface.&amp;nbsp; With the interface, Universal McCann employees can now quickly browse through the company’s intranet and find the latest content headlines, view the most relevant/popular portal content and easily learn about other employees at any office in the world. The social computing platform also enables employees to discover colleagues and subject matter experts, form social networks, and build communities based on areas of interest, rather than geography or project teams.&amp;nbsp; Universal McCann’s social computing platform enhances each person’s effectiveness with the collective wisdom of the worldwide organization – driving innovation and improved client service.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;“Businesses are experiencing firsthand the value of social computing in the enterprise,” said Deb Bannon, senior product manager for Microsoft’s SharePoint Server Partner Group. “As Universal McCann shows, SharePoint Server 2007 lets companies turn their portal into a customizable social computing hub that can change the way the company works. The combination of Social Sites and SharePoint is an example of what enterprise social networking is all about – delivering positive business results with a behind-the-firewall, flexible, and extensible platform.”&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;“More and more companies are looking for ways to connect their employees, using Web 2.0, social networking and information as a bridge,” said J.B. Holston, NewsGator CEO. “Social Sites and SharePoint Server 2007 give companies a way to introduce global social networking strategies that offer the ease-of-use of tools like Facebook or MySpace, but with enterprise-strength security and business-specific features. Social Sites allows companies to roll out a dynamic platform that makes information and knowledge a common currency among its employees and collaboration a common companywide practice.”&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Palo Alto, CA, June 4, 2008 –&lt;/STRONG&gt; RivalSoft Inc. today unveiled a major new release of RivalMap, the first web-based application that combines a unique set of features specifically designed to help companies of all sizes track and share information about their competitors and market. The new version of the application makes it easier for businesses to organize and address breaking news and important industry-related information.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;“RivalMap now offers key tools to help companies stay on top of important market changes and take advantage of emerging developments in their industry”, said Andrew Holt, Co-founder of RivalSoft. “Before RivalMap, information that companies had on competitors and market events was scattered through files, e-mails, and in the minds of colleagues. With RivalMap, companies have a single hub for industry information, providing a better way to discover important information and leverage it internally with less work. News, information, and discussions are easily centralized, organized, and made available to everyone inside a company. Competitor and market insights are crucial to a company's ability to make informed business decisions – RivalMap delivers a total solution for that need.” &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;“The addition of an automated news service, which makes use of NewsGator technologies, adds a new level of functionality to RivalMap,” said Kris Rasmussen, fellow Co-founder of RivalSoft. “RivalMap now brings together relevant news and feeds in one place where they can be harnessed collaboratively. RivalMap is tremendously valuable for companies that need to monitor their market and identify important updates and trends.” &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;“We are very excited about the integration of a news engine into RivalMap. In addition to providing the APIs, we use RivalMap internally and have seen the leap in value that integrated content provides,” said Jeff Nolan, VP of the SaaS group at NewsGator. “Our Smart Feeds are pulling in not only traditional content via RSS but also aggregating Twitter updates, LinkedIn messages, and many more sources all based on keywords.” &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;RivalMap is a web-based hosted application, with no set-up time or up-front fees. To get started, companies only have to create an account at &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;A href="http://www.rivalmap.com"&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;http://www.rivalmap.com&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt; (it takes less than a minute). After adding profiles for competitors and adding feeds or news keywords to track, any user with access can start clipping important news and posting updates, concerns, files, and other content. From that point forward, the company has one place for workers to access and discuss information on competitors, industry updates, collateral the company has (like sales assets), and more. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;Pricing &amp;amp; Information &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;RivalMap is free for up to 3 users, with access to the news feature for the first 30 days. For only $24/month companies get 3 users, unlimited news management, and file sharing. For $49/month companies get 5 users, $99/month allows 10 users, and $199/month allows 25 users, all with the addition of SSL encryption. Enterprise plans for accounts larger than 25 users are available. All paying plans include a 30-day free trial.

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Denver, Colo. — May 28, 2008 —&lt;/STRONG&gt; NewsGator Technologies, Inc., along with washingtonpost.com and Newsweek, today unveiled &lt;A href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/wireless/campaigntracker.htm"&gt;Campaign Tracker, a free application for Microsoft Windows Mobile phones&lt;/A&gt;. The Microsoft-sponsored mobile application will enhance washingtonpost.com’s and Newsweek’s up-to-the-minute, portable coverage on the 2008 candidates and elections.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;Harnessing the breadth of syndication solutions of NewsGator’s Mobile Reader, washingtonpost.com and Newsweek will aggregate political content from across their media properties, extending the reach of their brands and letting their readers access the most recent and popular news on any given candidate, right from their mobile phones. Campaign Tracker will also utilize NewsGator’s Editor’s Desk for full editorial control, enabling washingtonpost.com and Newsweek to create an optimal RSS feed reading experience and present the news in ways that will provide the most value to their readers.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;Campaign Tracker was developed in conjunction with Microsoft through Mobile2Market and runs on Microsoft Windows Mobile phones. Since the mobile application is not built on a Web site, readers can access the latest candidate news from wherever they are, even when they’re out of wireless range or on an airplane. Campaign Tracker makes for an enjoyable and fast mobile reading experience, as each post contains the entire article so there’s no need to click through to the source.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;“Developing innovative ways to distribute our content off our sites has been a top priority for us this year,” said Jennifer Moyer, COO, Washingtonpost.Newsweek Interactive. “We’re excited to utilize NewsGator’s aggregation service to more effectively provide mobile users with Microsoft Windows access to washingtonpost.com’s and Newsweek.com’s campaign and political news in real time.”&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;“Working with washingtonpost.com, Newsweek and Microsoft is terrific validation for NewsGator’s leadership in syndicating content and developing unique widgets and readers catered to today’s consumer tastes,” said Jeff Nolan, vice president, NewsGator’s Software-as-a-Service group. “NewsGator’s Mobile Reader gives media companies cutting-edge capabilities to deliver a wide range of content directly to a user, whether they’re commuting on a bus or flying across the country.”&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

Today on <a href="http://tv.boingboing.net/">Boing Boing tv</a>, <a href="http://xeni.net">Xeni</a> and <a href="http://pesco.net">Pesco</a> dive deeper into the magical chocolate factory founded by a NASA software developer. <p>
In this installment of BBtv's 3-part series on <a href="http://www.tcho.com/">TCHO Chocolate</a>, we learn more about the hacked-together, home-tinkered machines and high-tech wizardry that keep the factory running. The philosophy is "scrappy, not crappy," as founder Timothy Childs explains. <p>
TCHO's R&D lab contains such diverse components as Space Shuttle tape, a modded RONCO turkey oven, stone grinders used in Indian restaurants, and deconstructed space heater parts from the local hardware store.
<p>
Next, we zoom in to the molecular-level science behind this most delicious confection. Science buffs, rejoice! This episode is as fun for your eyes and brain as the "obsessively good" chocolate is for your mouth -- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(materials_science)">Polymorph</a> fun for the whole family.  <em>Warning: this episode is NSFC (not safe for chocoholics). </em><p>

            Neal Stephenson's forthcoming novel  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0061474096/downandoutint-20">Anathem</a> was inspired by the amazing Clock of the Long Now, a project to make a clock that runs for 10,000 years. The Long Now foundation is helping to launch the book with a signing in September in San Francisco, and its esteemed board members have been weighing in on the book:

“‘I suffer from attention surplus disorder,’ jokes a character in Anathem.  Attention surplus is exactly what Stephenson teaches his readers, in a book so tightly crafted it rewards instant rereading.” - Stewart Brand
<p>
“It is a great story, set in an alternative reality where people take long-term thinking seriously.”    - Danny Hillis
<p>
“Long Now’s 10,000-year clock inspired Neal Stephenson’s new story, Anathem, and now Anathem is inspiring the Long Now.  In ten centuries, no one will be sure which came first.”    - Kevin Kelly

            As I mentioned earlier, I'm giving a free talk tonight in Cambridge, UK. The seating is limited and filled up weeks ago, but the organisers now tell me that they've had 25 last-minute dropouts -- if you wanted to go but couldn't get a reservation, here's your chance! Follow the link below to reserve a ticket.

We made a bet, some decades ago, that the information economy would be based on buying and selling (and hence restricting copying of) information. We were totally, 100 percent wrong, and now the world’s in turmoil because of it. What does a copy-native economy look like? How do everyone from barbers to musicians become richer, more fulfilled and more civilly engaged in a real information society. And what do we do about the fact that a couple of dinosauric entertainment companies are determined to screw it up?

Cory Doctorow is a blogger, science fiction writer and journalist. He is an editor of Boing Boing, the 11th best blog in the world (according to Time Magazine). He was the 2006-2007 Canadian Fulbright Chair in Public Diplomacy at the USC Center on Public Diplomacy. He founded the software company Opencola which was later sold to the Open Text Corporation. He also writes regularly for The Guardian.
<p>
Cory will be speaking for one hour at 5:30pm on July 22nd 2008. UPDATE: Cory will now be speaking at Robinson College, Grange Road, Cambridge CB3 9AN.

<blockquote>
<img src="http://craphound.com/images/zine_fest_016.jpg"><br>
The two-day conference featured a wide variety of DIY arts and crafts, zines, comics and a gypsy-like atmosphere. Attending noobs were also treated to hands-on workshops, from bookbinding to illustration and Q & A sessions with accomplished self-publishers.
<p>
For zinesters, zines are like the blogs of the print world. They're an essential part of offline geek and underground culture and their DIY aesthetic has influenced an entire generation of designers and writers.

Instructables user Pyro222 has a great HOWTO for installing your keys in the handle of an old Leatherman Micra tool. I love this idea -- except the TSA would probably confiscate it, because installing a key in the hands of something that once held a knife confers magical, knife-like properties on the key (obviously).

Ospop has taken the classic Chinese Tian-Lang worker-sneaker, a handsome, highly evolved little plimsoll, and reworked it, adding insoles, designer colors, eyelets, improved laces -- and sweat-free labor practices -- to produce a high-fashion export version. I bought a pair last week in dark green and I've been wearing them around, and I've found them surprisingly comfy and exceptionally handsome. The tennies arrive wrapped in paper designed by noted calligrapher  Zhao Zhi Gang. The company is also running an educational charity for development in the area around its factory.

            Los Angeles's Machine Project continues with its series of seminars tonight with "Unix for N00bz: How To Access Your Data From Anywhere" -- a class on turning old PCs and hard-drives into network-attached storage devices that serve your files from anywhere.

<blockquote>
Since we are asking you to bring your own equipment to work with, the class will be structured into two parts:
<p>
First, a lecture covering the high level topics involved in setting up NAS at home and online. We’ll discuss the structure of the Internet, routers, IP addresses, DNS, dynamic DNS, and how you can configure many different kinds of computer systems to run the necessary services for access. There are some limitations however, and we’ll discuss those too.
<p>
Second, we’ll break into groups to work with the equipment you’ve brought. We’ll be setting up everything we’ve just discussed on the machine network and making a plan for what you’d need to do at home to get it working.

The film was written and directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Roger Corman. Although Coppola had been involved in at least two nudie films previously, Dementia 13 served as his first mainstream, "legitimate" directorial effort. The plot follows a scheming young woman who, after having inadvertently caused the heart attack death of her husband, attempts to have herself written into her rich mother-in-law's will. She pays a surprise visit to her late husband's family castle in Ireland, but her plans become permanently interrupted by an axe-wielding lunatic who begins to stalk and murderously hack away at members of the family.

<p>Fun story from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060530642/boingboing">Dinotopia</a> illustrator James Gurney:</p>
<blockquote>
  When <em>National Geographic</em> asked me to paint a small illustration of a Neanderthal father telling a story to his son, the art director emphasized that he should look recognizable, “like a guy who stepped off the subway.” Only the heavy brow ridge should give him away.

  <p>Where to find a model? I racked my brain for who would fit the part. One guy I knew named Jim would be ideal. But how should I ask him to pose? “Hey, Jim, would you mind posing for a Neanderthal picture I’m doing?” I was afraid he might be insulted.</p>

  <p>I managed to ask him, and he cooperated. Later I asked him if he minded being a cave man. “Not at all,” he replied with a smile. “My girlfriend says it gives me more sex appeal.”</p>

            Cops and their kids get to use confiscated cars in St. Louis for free.

  <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/stories.nsf/news/stlouiscitycounty/story/00834845f12de2cb8625748c00110686?OpenDocument">Seems that the city of St. Louis</a>, like many cities, allows the police to confiscate the cars of people suspected (but not necessarily convicted) of certain crimes. They have a contract with a city towing firm, and said firm was allowing police officers and their families to "rent" confiscated cars free of charge, sometimes for months on end. Officers and their families could also sometimes purchase the confiscated cars at a fraction of the cars' value.

  <p>All of that is pretty outrageous. But it gets better. <em>The St. Louis Post-Dispatch</em> stumbled onto the story after investigating the daughter of the city's police chief. She had been involved in a number of accidents with different cars. On several occasions she had wrecked a car, then simply gone down to the towing service to get a 60-80 percent discount on a new one. After one accident, her blood-alcohol concentration tested at .17. She wasn't arrested or charged. The department says it has "no idea" why she was let go.</p>

Seems that the city of St. Louis, like many cities, allows the police to confiscate the cars of people suspected (but not necessarily convicted) of certain crimes. They have a contract with a city towing firm, and said firm was allowing police officers and their families to "rent" confiscated cars free of charge, sometimes for months on end. Officers and their families could also sometimes purchase the confiscated cars at a fraction of the cars' value. All of that is pretty outrageous. But it gets better. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch stumbled onto the story after investigating the daughter of the city's police chief. She had been involved in a number of accidents with different cars. On several occasions she had wrecked a car, then simply gone down to the towing service to get a 60-80 percent discount on a new one. After one accident, her blood-alcohol concentration tested at .17. She wasn't arrested or charged. The department says it has "no idea" why she was let go.

  On Monday of last week I was bitten by a yet unknown poisonous spider on my right knee. By Tuesday I was running a high fever and unable to walk.

After a series of x-rays and a whole lot of examination, I was informed that I had a rather large abscess and cellulitis due to the spider's bite. I was sent home early Saturday morning after having my knee surgically "drained", and in more pain than I have ever been in. After a doctor's appointment this Monday, another abscess was drained and I was informed that I would need to see a doctor weekly until the wound had healed, which could possibly take up to 8 months. Within these 8 months there will remain the very real threat of the infection spreading into the bone of my knee, as well as the possibility of blood poisoning.

  <p>Any possible commission you could have for me; gifts, wedding invitations, cards, wall art, tattoos, anything. I am interested in the job. I will also definitely consider larger personal commissions, considering the work involved. I would prefer to only be working in black and white, but don't be afraid to ask about color. I haven't exactly figured out how pricing will go yet, but obviously pricing will be negotiable and varying, but for small to medium sized drawings I was thinking between $100 - $500 through paypal.</p>

Frank Calloway draws pen, marker, and crayon murals on butcher block paper, some more than 30 feet long. Calloway is 112 years old and has lived in mental hospitals since 1952. His work will be featured in an exhibit at Baltimore's <a href="http://www.avam.org/">American Visionary Art Museum</a>. The Associated Press profiled Calloway and created a wonderful <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/LIVING/07/20/elderly.artist.ap/index.html#cnnSTCOther1">slideshow</a> with Calloway speaking. From the AP:

<blockquote>Calloway views art as his job and sits at a table by a window drawing for seven to nine hours a day, usually wearing blue denim overalls and a crisp dress shirt, said Nedra Moncrief-Craig, director of Alice M. Kidd Nursing Facility, a state home where Calloway lives...<br><br>
(America Visionary Art Museum director Rebecca) Hoffberger called Calloway brilliant and described looking through notebooks full of numbers he keeps and noticing that there was a definite logical pattern to the strings of figures.

<br><Br>
Rows of numbers line the edges of some of his artwork, and he sometimes stops in the middle of conversations to methodically recite multiplication tables.
<br><Br>
Calloway is content being quietly absorbed in his work, but he also enjoys talking if people ask questions, Moncrief-Craig said. He listens intently and responds at length in a deep, gravelly voice as he rocks gently back and forth, often punctuating the end of a story with a soft chuckle and a huge smile that lights up a broad face that has very few wrinkles.</blockquote>

Boing Boing tv's UK-based music correspondent <a href="http://tv.boingboing.net/russell-porter/">Russell Porter</a> of "<a href="http://www.porterreport.com/">Porter Report</a>" fame interviews the legendary <a href="http://myspace.com/hot8brassband">Hot 8 Brass Band</a>, from New Orleans. <p>Band leader Bennie "Big Peter" Pete explains the history of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_line">second line</a>, the roots of New Orleans jazz, and what it took to survive as jazz band in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Quarter">French Quarter</a>.  
<p>
Today's BBtv episode is a little longer than usual -- 9 minutes -- so we can share with you an extended musical segment, with the Hot 8 performing their song "What's My Name" live on the streets of Brighton.  Their performance is breathtaking, and quite possibly the funkiest, most soulful sounds you've ever heard on Boing Boing. The band is currently <a href="http://www.hot8brassband.com/">on tour throughout the USA</a>. Enjoy!<p>

            Stewart and Mueller's paper, "Assessing the risks, costs and benefits of United States aviation security measures," (published by the University of Newcastle, Australia) does an amazing job of unpicking which post-911 security measures actually <em>work</em> and which ones are showy wastes of money and pocket-liners for slimy government contractors:

 <blockquote>
Hardening cockpit doors has the highest risk reduction (16.67%) at lowest additional cost of $40 million. On the other hand, the Federal Air Marshal Service costs $900 million pa but reduces risk by only 1.67%. The Federal Air Marshal Service may be more cost-effective if it is able to show extra benefit over the cheaper measure of hardening cockpit doors. However, the Federal Air Marshal Service seems to have significantly less benefit which means that hardening cockpit doors is the more cost-effective measure.

            The good people at the Mr and Mrs Smith travel books have started up a blog. Mr and Mrs Smith guides review romantic boutique hotels around the world -- great places to go away for a dirty weekend (and check in as Mr and Mrs Smith, natch). I've reviewed a couple hotels for them in the past -- not as a paid gig, just because it was so much fun -- and I've since become an avid fan of the guides, both for planning real trips and for daydreaming about places I might go someday. The blog is a great source of sybaritic pleasure taken very seriously indeed.

            <img src="http://craphound.com/images/2686262863_a843378b75.jpg"><br>
Yesterday, I got one of the best and most memorable birthday presents of my life -- a trip to the legendary Bletchley Park, site of the British WWII codebreaking effort, where Turing and co invented modern computer science and cryptography. The site is just as I'd imagined it -- a rotting, lovely old mansion surrounded by modest, slope-shouldered sheds with a variety of exhibits staffed by knowledgeable, friendly geeks who clearly find it all every bit as exciting as I do.
<p>
<img src="http://craphound.com/images/2686083107_f433dff924.jpg" align="left">
The exhibits are a nice mix of technical and historical, ranging from a truly impressive collection of memorabilia related to Winston Churchill (who visited Bletchley and congratulated the women and men there on their excellent work), including his school report-card that makes him out to be a villainous, disruptive and scattered child; to a series of exhibits of vintage wartime toys. There's a museum of ancient cinematographic equipment complete with a beautiful little theatre that shows reels of vintage newsreels and propaganda films. And of course, there are the computers and related devices. 
<br clear="all">
<p>
<img src="http://craphound.com/images/2686066749_391025c547.jpg"><br>
The cipher machines and radio equipment naturally form the  centerpiece of the museum, and there's an entire computer history museum onsite (it was closed, with the <em>strangest</em> sign I've ever seen, words to the effect of, "This site is closed for maintenance. Enter at your own risk. You may be escorted off the grounds by security if you are caught here." Huh?) along with the notorious Nazi Enigma machine that was kidnapped in 2000 and ransomed back (the crime was never solved). The historic material on the Enigma (which began life as a commercial product before the war!) is really excellent, as are the technical explanations of how it worked.
<p>
<img src="http://craphound.com/images/2686175845_cba878f09e.jpg"><br>
But best of all are the  "rebuilds" -- reconstructions from plans of the bombes (parallel decoding machines) and Colossus (the massive and gorgeous machine that was one of the earliest general-purpose computers. These hulking beasts are real artisanal pieces, with the hand-crafted, prideful look of devices built by loving and obsessive engineers who really, <em>really</em> care about their work.
<p>
<img src="http://craphound.com/images/2686129749_872498efb6.jpg"><br>
Walking the grounds, I got a real sense of the lives of the people who'd worked at Bletchley, through a series of exhibitions that included quotations from oral histories about the dress, romance, food, family life and internecine conflict that characterized Bletchley Park during the war years. The exhibit on clothing was especially memorable, if only because it could bring home the gold for Britain in the 2012 Scariest Mannequin event, as was the astoundingly cool room devoted to the wartime use of messenger pigeons, including replicas of the awards given to especially brave and dedicated birds. 
<p>
<img src="http://craphound.com/images/2686860580_04c54c0158.jpg" align="left">
We spent three hours on site and barely scratched the surface. We had hardly any time to look at the war-plane, didn't get to the gigantic model railroad exhibit, didn't see the whole film presentation at the Enigma theatre, and only got the most hurried of walks around the American Gardens -- and we missed the mansion tour altogether. I could have easily spent eight or more hours there, and still wanted for more. Just the tantalizing mini-lecture I got on the Colossus rebuild from one of the electronics engineers who worked on it was enough to pique my interest, and I could have spent an hour looking at the details in Turing's office. 
<p>
<img src="http://craphound.com/images/2686237951_91c88d5579.jpg"><br>
The Trust that runs Bletchley Park has done a really fine job, and is clearly thinking creatively about the best way to continue to fund their operations. The mansion's slate roof is in need of a multi-million-pound replacement, and they're selling "genuine fragments" of the existing slate -- holy relics of crypto's formative years, as well as soliciting donations and selling memberships. But most intriguing was the idea of renting out part or all of the site for parties and weddings -- maybe for my 40th birthday in three years...

            I've always loved amateur radio enthusiasts, and many's the time I wished I had a Ham license and a set of my own. But as cool as Ham is as a hobby, it is infinitely cooler for the Hams of Milton Keynes, UK, who are within spitting distance of the legendary Bletchley Park, the site of the famous WWII codebreaking effort that decoded the Nazi messages captured by intrepid Hams from across the UK using giant, beautiful computers. The Milton Keynes Amateur Radio Society actually <em>meets</em> at Bletchley Park on Mondays, and volunteers from the society staff a booth in the museum, surrounded by postcards and certificates from other Hams around the world.

In 1993, Radio Club Members Warren Backhouse,  John James, Eric Simpson and David White, who had been meeting every Wednesday at the Bletchley Park Social Club for many years, decided to assist in a recently set-up project to save the Bletchley Park code breaking centre from demolition. Their (unspoken) objective was to secure a toe-hold on the Bletchley Park site, with the intention of obtaining premises which would be suitable for use by the Radio Club.
<p>
            Warren Backhouse became the Chairman of this unofficial  group, which attended many meetings for volunteers, held between mid 1993 and 5th February 1994 when Bletchley Park opened to the Public for the first time. The group constructed a  working replica of a Middle-East “Y“ Station[1], which at the time was the only operational exhibit on the site.

The instructions supplied explain how Pocket Enigma works and take the user step-by-step through the process of coding and decoding.  Worked examples and carefully annotated figures illustrate how the Key and Message Setting are used, and there is a trouble-shooting table to help with common errors.
For young readers there is also a simplified way of using it called Junior Pocket Enigma making it suitable for all ages who can read and write their own messages.

They're publishing great original fiction -- they've got stories by John Scalzi and Charlie Stross up now, and I've got one coming soon, called THE THINGS THAT MAKE ME WEAK AND STRANGE GET ENGINEERED AWAY -- with original illustration by the talented Tor art team. They're running fascinating blog-posts on diverse subjects from a team of bloggers that includes in-house people from across the business and outside "friends of Tor" including novelists, fans, critics, and sundry others. And there's a social networking system that ties it all together.
<p>
Oh, and for a short time, they're also hosting <em>all</em> the free ebooks they gave away to entice you to sign up for the launch-announcement. Run, don't walk.

   <summary>SusanG at the DailyKos has a callout for John Cole&apos;s post about earmarks. As Cole put&apos;s it: The total national debt, as I write this, is $9,679,000,000,000.00 (nine and a half trillion).

The Budget for 2008 is close to $3,000,000,000,000.00 (three trillion).

Our budget deficit for this year is going to range in between $400-500,000,000,000.00 (four hundred to five hundred billion, give or take a few billion).

The total value of earmarks in 2008 will be approximately $18,000,000,000.00 (eighteen billion).

In other words, when McCain talks about earmarks, he is talking about 3% of our annual budget deficit, .6% of our annual budget, and a number too small to even report when discussing our national debt. Or, put another way, he is talking about two months in Iraq, something he wants to keep going indefinitely.

Not only are they lying about Palin’s involvements with earmarks, they are just not being serious about the horrible economic problems we face. These are not serious people.

I think this is missing the point. True, earmarks are small potatoes. But the problem with earmarks is that they&apos;ve become an engine of corruption. The explosion after the Republicans took over under Newt was because they were a newly deployed source of influence, designed (too often) to induce or repay a gift (or what others call, a campaign contribution). 

Liberals should be as upset with this as conservatives (though for different reasons no doubt). And we should especially (imho) resist the &quot;if McCain believes it it must be wrong&quot; trope. McCain is right to criticize earmarks. Whether he (or Palin) can do it credibly is a separate matter. </summary>

Specs in the extended entry below. </p>]]>
      <![CDATA[<blockquote>Stanford Law School Announces Center for Internet and Society and
Stanford Constitutional Law Center Joint Fellowship

<p><br />
The Stanford Law School Center for Internet and Society (CIS) and The <br />
Stanford Constitutional Law Center (CLC) announce a new joint <br />
fellowship for the study of the intersection of copyright and <br />
constitutional law.  We are looking for an inaugural fellow to work <br />
with faculty and staff from both Centers on range of research and <br />
litigation projects addressing the relationship between the <br />
Constitution's Copyright Clause, the First Amendment and the Fair Use <br />
Doctrine.</p>

<p>The primary responsibility for the fellow will be to work on current <br />
CIS Fair Use Project litigation.   In addition, the Fellow will also <br />
be an active part of the CIS and CLC communities, attending lectures <br />
and symposia, assisting with Center activities and working with <br />
students on related projects. The Fellowship will provide significant <br />
opportunity for the pursuit of individual research and scholarship in <br />
preparation to enter the academic teaching market. The fellowship <br />
position is offered for one year with the opportunity for renewal.</p>

<p>About the Centers</p>

<p>The CIS is a leading center for the study of the relationship between <br />
the public interest, law and technology. Deploying scholarship, <br />
symposia, advocacy, or litigation as necessary, we focus on areas <br />
where new technologies and old laws intersect and ask whether changes <br />
in either are appropriate.  CIS was founded by Professor of Law <br />
Lawrence Lessig and is headed by Executive Director Lauren Gelman.</p>

<p>The Fair Use Project (FUP) is a new CIS initiative launched in 2006 <br />
and lead by Executive Director Anthony Falzone.   The FUP's mission <br />
is to clarify, define and expand the bounds of fair use primarily <br />
through litigation.  The FUP also develops and promotes fair use <br />
education and counsels creators, such as documentary filmmakers on <br />
appropriate uses of copyrighted works.</p>

<p>The Stanford Constitutional Law Center, founded in September 2006 by <br />
former dean Kathleen M. Sullivan and Derek Shaffer '00, grows out of <br />
the long and distinguished tradition of constitutional law <br />
scholarship at Stanford Law School. The Center seeks to carry on that <br />
tradition in a variety of ways-academic conferences, public lectures, <br />
policy research projects, and pro bono litigation-aimed at gathering <br />
consensus and advancing constitutional norms both domestically and <br />
internationally. Stanford law students, particularly those enrolled <br />
in a Constitutional Law Workshop, are intimately involved in all of <br />
the Center's activities.</p>

<p>Applicant Requirements:</p>

<p>2-5 years of post-law school civil litigation experience with <br />
substantial experience in constitutional law (preferred) and <br />
intellectual property (required) matters;</p>

<p>Excellent writing and analytic skills;</p>

<p>Demonstrated ability to direct litigation of impact cases; and</p>

<p>Demonstrated ability to work in a self-directed and entrepreneurial <br />
environment.</p>

<p>The position is for 12 months, with the possibility of renewal for a <br />
second twelve months. The start date is September 2008, although this <br />
may be flexible depending on the right candidates availability. <br />
Salary will be approximately $40,000 per year, with benefits.</p>

<p>Preferred submission deadline is September 8, 2008, however <br />
applications will be accepted until the position is filled.</p>

<p>Applicants MUST apply online via the Stanford Jobs <a href="http://jobs.stanford.edu/find_a_job.html">website</a></p>

<p>Search "Job number 31382"</p>

<p>Applications may also be submitted by email to the following address: <br />
Gelman [at] stanford.edu.</p>

Obama has famously (and rightfully) refused money from lobbyists and PACs. After he became the presumptive nominee, the DNC did the same. But both the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee still accept money from lobbyists and PACs. 

As this issue of reform is (sadly) increasingly invisible in this campaign, we at Change Congress are launching a campaign to get the Dems to be consistent about this. 

Ideally, the DSCC and DCCC should follow Obama&apos;s lead, and swear off lobbyists &amp; PAC money. Or at the very least, both should promise to do so if the Republicans do. 

We&apos;ve started a petition. Please help spread it. </summary>

   <title>a plea to the press: Please just cover the convention(s)</title>

   <summary>The Democrats have a HD broadcast of their convention, but only on some platforms, through a Microsoft product. Those fortunate enough to own the most modern technology (and (contrary to the norm) fortunate enough to have fast broadband) can get full convention coverage. 

The rest of America (to the extent they care, and the point may be related) are stuck with broadcasters coverage. From NPR to the networks, &quot;coverage&quot; means some ridiculous unprepared interview with a party has-been, while a prepared speech by someone currently significant is being given in the background. (e.g., Jim Leach, former GOP Congressman from Iowa, speaking in the background as NPR interviews Walter Mondale. Leach&apos;s speech was fantastic. Mondale&apos;s, well, you get the point.)

Please, networks, and especially, NPR, can you please just cover the convention -- both the Democratic and Republican. Obviously, it is party propaganda. But it is also American politics. It is ridiculous that the only people who actually get to see what each party believes it should say are those who are at the Convention, or those with powerful computers and fast technology. </summary>

				<title>Sandisk Says Vista Not Optimized For SSD </title>

				<guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.lockergnome.com/blade/2008/07/22/sandisk-says-vista-not-optimized-for-ssd/</guid>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="float: left; padding: 10px;"><img src="http://static.lockergnome.com/avatars/author_45? 1179783897" alt="Author Avatar" /></div>Sandisk has made a stunning announcement that Microsoft's flagship operating system is not currently optimized for SSD [Solid State Drives], which are currently being used in Apple's Air computer and also on some models from Toshiba. In an article from C/Net the CEO of Sandisk has stated:
<blockquote><strong>Speaking during SanDisk's second-quarter earnings conference call, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Eli Harari said that Windows Vista will present a special challenge for solid state drive makers. "As soon as you get into Vista applications in notebook and desktop, you start running into very demanding applications because Vista is not optimized for flash memory solid state disk," he said. </strong>

<strong>This is due to Vista's design.  "The next generation controllers need to basically compensate for Vista shortfalls," he said.  </strong>

<strong>"Unfortunately, (SSDs) performance in the Vista environment falls short of what the market really needs and that is why we need to develop the next generation, which we'll start sampling end of this year, early next year," Harari said.</strong></blockquote>
I went to the Sandisk web site and found this press release which seems to indicate that the new Netbooks, using Microsoft's Windows XP, seem to work just fine.
<blockquote><strong>A pioneer in developing SSDs for laptop computers, tablet PCs and blade servers, SanDisk is making the new SSD modules available in 4-, 8- and 16-gigabyte (GB)<sup>1</sup> capacities, with a streaming read speed of 39 megabytes per second (MB/s)<sup>2</sup> and a streaming write performance of 17MB/s.<sup>2</sup> Supporting both Linux and Microsoft<sup>??</sup> Windows<sup>??</sup> XP operating systems, SanDisk pSSD solid state drives are being shown this week at Computex Taipei, where SanDisk is exhibiting at Booth M320 in Nangang Exhibition Hall.</strong>

<strong>SanDisk???s pSSD solid state drives, which are expected to be available starting in August, are built using the company???s reliable Multi-Level Cell (MLC) and Single-Level Cell (SLC) flash memory. This technology is produced at fabrication plants in Yokkaichi, Japan, where SanDisk and its partner, Toshiba Corporation, share the output. The two companies have co-developed many of the designs and technologies in NAND flash.</strong>

<strong>ULCPCs are inexpensive handheld laptops ??? smaller than a conventional notebook computer but larger than a mobile ???smart??? phone ??? that are easy to carry and cost in the range of $250 to $350. They enable consumers to browse the Internet on the go, with a user interface that replicates that of larger PCs. Originally, ULCPCs were developed as low-cost computing solutions for school children in developing nations. But the diminutive devices have caught on with adults, and now manufacturers are rolling out devices that are designed for general consumer use.??Other names for these include Ultra-Mobile PC (UMPC) and Mobile Internet Device (MID).</strong></blockquote>
This one statement '<strong>Supporting both Linux and Microsoft<sup>??</sup> Windows<sup>??</sup> XP operating systems'</strong> says it all and confirms why Microsoft has had to continue using Windows XP for these devices. It was first hinted that Vista, because of its high hardware and resource issues, was the main reason that Netbooks were not using Vista. Now it appears there were also other issues behind the decision to go with XP.

Which makes one wonder. With these new Netwooks hitting the street in August, which will come with either Linux or Windows XP, how long will Microsoft need to keep supporting XP? It would appear if these new computers sell in the millions of unit as is suspected, that Windows XP may have a long, long life span. :-)

				<title>Microsoft Says Vista Is Fixed - Spends $300 M To Convince Us</title>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="float: left; padding: 10px;"><img src="http://static.lockergnome.com/avatars/author_45? 1179783897" alt="Author Avatar" /></div>Microsoft has another strategy to convince the public that Vista is now fixed and they want you to 'look how far we've come' campaign. Microsoft is going to try and convince the masses that Vista is great and better than the reputation that continues to haunt the operating system. Which may take some doing. On their website they state:
<blockquote>
<h4><strong>Windows Vista: Look how far we've come</strong></h4>
<strong>When Windows Vista debuted in January 2007, we declared it the best operating system we had ever made. "Windows Vista is beautiful," <em>The New York Times</em> raved. It's humbling that millions of you agree.</strong>
<p><strong>But we know a few of you were disappointed by your early encounter. Printers didn't work. Games felt sluggish. You told us???loudly at times???that the latest Windows wasn't always living up to your high expectations for a Microsoft product.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Well, we've been taking notes and addressing issues.</strong></p>
<p><strong>So as we prepare to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-xp/future.aspx">stop selling Windows XP on June 30</a>, it felt like the right time to update you on our progress, highlighted by the recent release of Windows Vista Service Pack 1 (SP1).</strong></p>
<p><strong>While we're at it, we'd like to clear up some confusion and lingering misunderstandings about Windows Vista???and our plans for its predecessor, Windows XP.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Microsoft also has a 100 reasons why section that makes for interesting reading:</p>

<blockquote>
<h3><strong>1. Windows Vista makes using your PC a breeze</strong></h3>
<p><strong> Windows Vista features a breakthrough design and easy-to-use organizational tools that make it simpler to get things done and get on with life! Find what you need instantly, on your PC or on the web, with </strong><strong>Instant Search</strong>. Bring more clarity to your tasks with the spectacular <strong>Windows Aero</strong> user experience and <strong>Windows Flip 3D</strong>,<sup><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-vista/footnotes.aspx">A</a></sup> allowing you to see everything you're working on at a glance. 	  </p>
</blockquote>
Plus 99 more.

But what is confusing is this. If Microsoft has really sold 180 million copies of Vista, why the panic mode? Now that XP is no longer being offered on new computers, won't this automatically force everyone into using Vista?

Naturally we consumers look a Vista differently than do businesses. It appears it is the businesses that are reluctant to switch. That's where the money is. :-)

What do you think? Comments as always are welcome.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="float: left; padding: 10px;"><img src="http://static.lockergnome.com/avatars/author_45? 1179783897" alt="Author Avatar" /></div>It seems that Trans Union, which is one of the folks who monitor our credit, may have been selling our information to outside agencies. So if you fall into one of these categories, and most of us do, you may entitled to compensation:
<blockquote><strong>The Court decided that the Class includes all consumers who had an open credit account or an open line of credit from a credit grantor (including, for instance automobile loans, bank credit cards, department store credit cards, other retail store credit cards, finance company loans,
mortgage loans, and student loans) located in the United States anytime from January 1, 1987 to May 28, 2008. </strong></blockquote>
You may entitled to receive one of the following:
<blockquote><strong>The settlement will: (1) establish a $75 million Settlement Fund; (2)</strong><strong> give Class members the option of selecting six or nine months of credit</strong><strong> monitoring services; (3) donate $150,000 to non-profit organizations;</strong><strong> (4) pay for settlements or judgments for damage claims related to</strong>
<strong>lawsuits brought individually by Class members against the Defendants;</strong><strong> (5) pay class counsels??? attorneys??? fees and their expenses; (6) pay</strong><strong> the costs of notice and administering the settlement; and (7) distribute</strong><strong> any money remaining (after deducting the costs for everything listed</strong>
<strong>above) in the Settlement Fund to Class members who register for a</strong><strong> payment or to non-profit organizations.</strong></blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>The six months of credit monitoring services (which retails for</strong><strong> $59.75) include: (1) the ability to lock your credit report so third</strong><strong> parties, such as lenders or other companies, will not be able to access</strong><strong> your credit report without your consent (unless allowed by law); (2)</strong>
<strong>unlimited daily access to your Trans Union credit report and credit</strong><strong> score; and (3) credit monitoring with a 24-hour email credit notification</strong><strong>service. The nine months of enhanced credit monitoring services</strong><strong> (which retails for $115.50) includes all the services listed above, plus</strong>
<strong>a suite of insurance scores and a mortgage simulator service. If you</strong><strong> get the enhanced credit monitoring you will not be able to get a payment </strong><strong>from the settlement or start an individual lawsuit.</strong></blockquote>
Other options are also available. Take a look at the web site which has all of the options as well as a form you must complete.

One of the Web 2.0 thingies that I am interested in is KM (Knowledge Management).  In this day and age, one needs at least some type of PKM (Personal Knowledge Management).  Bill Ives over at <a href="http://billives.typepad.com/portals_and_km/" title="Portal and KM">Portal and KM</a> often blogs on this topic. In his latest <a href="http://billives.typepad.com/portals_and_km/2008/07/larry-chaits-tw.html" title="Larry Chait???s Twenty Cool Web Sites">post</a> he mentions they closed the event with a nice list of links.
</p><p>
You can grab the power point presentation over at the link Mr. Ives mentions.  Here are just a few of the 20:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.accessmylibrary.com/" title="Access My Library">Access My Library</a> - 29 Million Articles Online</li>
<li><a href="http://www.soople.com/" title="Scoople">Scoople</a> makes all the advanced search features of Google easier</li>
</ul>
<p>
I am not going to give the whole list or comment much on this.  I just think most of the links are great.  You have 18 more to look over and decide for yourself. (You also have two more good feeds to subscribe to if you wish.)  Thanks for Reading.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="float: left; padding: 10px;"><img src="http://static.lockergnome.com/avatars/author_22? 1182387784" alt="Author Avatar" /></div>As I was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Features_removed_from_Windows_Vista">combing over this</a> today, I could not help but wonder why some of the items were removed at all? Take DXDiag for instance. This is a tool that nearly every gamer out there is aware of and has likely used to diagnose issues with DirectX. Why was it cut - get this, it is not "cross platform friendly". Yup, however according to this, cross platform with regard to Microsoft's gaming platforms - Xbox and Windows.

<p>So by this logic, because it <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/al_msft/archive/2006/03/20/555065.aspx">will not work on Xbox</a>...then it must be eliminated from Windows! Wait, huh?

<blockquote><p><em><strong>2) APIs that are eliminated because no cross-platform counterpart exists</strong></em>

</p><p><em>??DxDiag gets cut.?? There is no real equivalent on Xbox 360 today.?? MDX1.1 will continue to support a managed wrapper for DxDiag.?? Do you have any concerns here??? If so, let us know.  </em></p></blockquote>

Yeah, I have "a concern".I think I speak for a number of Windows users who might object to having their DirectX diagnostic ability being neutered. But that is just me.

</p><p>Then there is one that I do understand it being phased out, yet had to DIG for its suggested replacement? SerialKeys. Yes, for those who need extra accessibility features with their Windows desktop,<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/enable/products/windowsvista/"> SerialKeys</a> was a valued option and having it installed was a major boon to the platform. Unfortunately this is no longer the case. And as surprising as this may seem, I have no problem with this per se. I just wish the replacements: <a href="http://www.eyegaze.com/skeys/index.htm">SKEYS</a> and <a href="http://www.aacinstitute.org/Resources/ProductsandServices/AACKeys/AACKeys.html">AAC Keys</a> were more readily suggested for new Vista users. Seriously!

</p><p>On the plus side, despite some people finding it to be annoying, Vista is inherently more secure than previous releases of Windows. And eliminating some of those dated little extras might very well spell less future exploits in the future? I am speculating, but it sure sounds plausible at least...

</p><p>What say you? Are there any features you had with XP that you are finding lacking in Vista? Perhaps something was added with Vista that was lacking in XP? Whatever it may be, hit the comments and tell me about it.</p> <p>Related Articles: <div class="">			<ul>

<p>We all have networks of some kind. No matter whether you have two computers or 2000 on your network, you&#8217;ll need tools to manage it. This is why I love talking to Josh Stephens from SolarWinds. In the recent past, Josh and I got together to discuss <a href="http://www.solarwinds.com/lockergnome/">Exchange Monitor</a>. Today, we talked specifically about troubleshooting user performance on a network. I wanted to get his take on this, as I know it&#8217;s something he deals with on a daily basis. </p>

<p>According to Josh, networks today are more complex than they used to be. We&#8217;re using them for far more than we have in the past, and many of the things are bandwidth intensive. When he has to start narrowing down a problem, the first three rules of troubleshooting a network is check the cable, check the cable, check the cable. It sounds silly, but it happens much more often than you would think. </p>
<p>I asked Josh if turning on wireless actually impede the wired connections between computers on the network. Josh indicated that you can use some of the tools from SolarWinds to measure performance of your network both before and after you make any changes. If you&#8217;re having trouble with performance and you have wireless&#8230; check first to make sure if there&#8217;s a firmware update available for your access point. That can make a tremendous difference. There are many little things that could cause you to have issues with a wireless network, so using tools like SolarWinds has available can certainly help diagnose and manage it.</p>
<p>Another question that came up was wondering what Josh believed the greatest threat is to networks in the coming years. Josh tends to think that as far as things like viruses go, the network gear today is very well equipped to handle them. He doesn&#8217;t see threats like that as much of an issue. What he does feel that Network Admins should be aware of is the idea of having real-time collaborative conferencing. It&#8217;s really just barely starting to take off, and will likely grow very quickly. You need to stay a few steps ahead of the users you are providing support to. </p>
<p>I get a lot of people constantly asking me about tweaks. I wondered if many of the &#8220;popular&#8221; tweaks are actually valid. Josh stated there truly is a lot of things that can be tweaked in order to enhance your network performance. You definitely want to make sure you know what you&#8217;re doing before diving in to make major changes, and always back up everything you can before beginning. </p>

				<title>Setting Up Encryption In Vista Part III </title>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="float: left; padding: 10px;"><img src="http://static.lockergnome.com/avatars/author_15? 1176130187" alt="Author Avatar" /></div><p>In the Part II of this series, you learned how to encrypt files in Vista and verify that users are unable to open the encrypted files. An important point to keep in mind is that although the user is unable to open the file, they can delete the file. You might be confused as to how this is possible.</p>

<p>Here is the answer: The user has full-share and NTFS permissions to the file. These permissions include reading, modifying, and deleting the file. If the user does not try to open the file, the EFS subsystem isn't required. If the user tries to open the file, the EFS subsystem intervenes and denies access. But users can simply delete the file, which they have rights to do as defined by the NTFS permissions. Remember, file encryption is used to protect the contents of a file from prying eyes. It is not designed to protect the file itself. That's why a properly designed share and NTFS structure is still critical even when using EFS.</p>

<p>In Vista, multiple users can be granted rights to read and modify encrypted files. Right click the encrypted file that you want to share and click Properties. From the General tab, click the Advanced button. From the Advanced Attributes dialog box, click the Details button. Click the Add button. Select the user to whom you want to grant access to the encrypted file. Click OK. Once the appropriate user has been granted permission, they will be able to open the file.</p>

<p>When an encrypted file is moved or copied from its source location to a new location, it is first decrypted. But this isn't a hole in the security scheme. To copy or move an encrypted file, you must have the ability to open the encrypted file. In fact, even if a user has NTFS rights but doesn't have rights to decrypt the file, he or she will be greeted with an error message.</p>

				<title>Michael Savage Controversial Autism Remark</title>

				<guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.lockergnome.com/jtrooster/2008/07/21/michael-savage-speaks-out-about-autism/</guid>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="float: left; padding: 10px;"><img src="http://static.lockergnome.com/avatars/author_3638? 1211949831" alt="Author Avatar" /></div><font size="3" face="Garamond Premr Pro">I've been on a lull lately,  wondering what subject I should attack next (as there are so many these days!) -  but nothing has really grabbed my attention over the last month or so... until  now! I owe thanks to Michael Savage for my next topic of discussion... his  recent remark which to the untrained ear, sounded like an attack on autistic  children when he recently described autistic children as being brats. While on  the subject of Autistic children he said "In 99 percent of the cases, it's  a brat who hasn't been told to cut the act out," to which I say, Rock on  Mike! As I wrote about in my <a href="http://www.lockergnome.com/jtrooster/2008/04/03/spank-that-kid/">blog regarding spanking</a>, kids these days have it  much too easy and are practically given excuses from parents, teachers, the medical field and even the government?? to act like barbaric, selfish little sociopaths'  - however, the order and the adjectives used in the previous sentence may vary  depending on parenting.??</font>

<font size="3" face="Garamond Premr Pro">Mind you I that I do not typically  agree with about 60% of what Michael has to say, but to his defense he was not  attacking kids that really are afflicted with the disease, but instead he was  taking shots at the medical profession (<a href="http://www.lockergnome.com/jtrooster/2008/04/07/modern-medicine-a-joke/">read my blog about that</a> too if you like)  as well as poor parenting. What I see his point as being is that this modern era  of medicine is worse than all the crack and heroin dealers combined, that kids  are being labeled as something that they are not just to shove drugs in their  face. The drug companies want to deal their drugs and what better target market  than to appeal to overcritical and under informed parents that think the problem  lies with their child, not with their own lousy parenting, a medical  misdiagnosis or the possibility that their kid just might be anti social and  would prefer to be left alone, in my day it was called; being a loner - I was  one of those kids.??</font>

<font size="3" face="Garamond Premr Pro">A good friend of mine knows an  "Autistic" child, I use quotes because she isn't convinced that the  little boy is actually Autistic. He runs, plays, laughs, gives hugs, loves  watching his cartoons, yet he is on drugs to manage his "Autism." His  parents both work long hours including weekends, he spends most of his time with  a daycare provider as well as his grandparents. Sometimes he plays with the  other kids at daycare, sometimes he doesn't. But his parents are certain that  their boy has the disease because he doesn't quite relate to them, is  distant and tends to act up while in their presence... hmm, I can't help but to wonder why?</font>

<font size="3" face="Garamond Premr Pro">Of course we can't have a statement  like the one Michael said without people crawling out of the woodwork to  protest. I have to ask though, what are they protesting?.. the disease itself or  the fact that these people have no idea how to interpret their child's actions  as well as a statement made more or less on their own behalf? Either way it's no  surprise to me. We are a people that no longer choose to help ourselves, instead  we rely on others to make our decisions for us, at least for the most part. I.E.  we need a drug to manage our cholesterol while proper diet and exercise are  merely secondary if not optional all together.?? </font>

<font size="3" face="Garamond Premr Pro">It seems Autism is being taken much too lightly and labeling a child as such is becoming much too quick and easy. What really irks me though are the</font><font size="3" face="Garamond Premr Pro"> people who constantly feel the need to go out of their way to protest mere words spoken by one man indirectly at no one specific. In this case, Michael was simply describing his distaste for the ignorance of a public that seems all to eager to diagnose a child with a life altering disease, speaking on the behalf of those who cannot. Seems admirable to me. Instead, his words have been twisted and deformed, the meaning was lost and those waiting to protest something are out in full force... speaking of, where the hell is Al Sharpton? </font> <p>Related Articles: <div class="">			<ul>

				<title>Funeral Planned For Computer Mouse In 5 Years</title>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="float: left; padding: 10px;"><img src="http://static.lockergnome.com/avatars/author_3947? 1216593108" alt="Author Avatar" /></div>I am a fan of the computer mouse. If I could, I would let it interact in my world when ever possible. So it saddens me to hear that the demise of this 40 year old innovation will be ending very soon reports the BBC in an interview with Gartner??representative, Steve Prentice:??<blockquote>"The mouse works fine in the desktop environment but for home entertainment or working on a notebook it's over."????</blockquote><blockquote>??"You've got Panasonic showing forward facing video in the home entertainment environment. Instead of using a conventional remote control you hold up your hand and it recognises you have done that."</blockquote>Prentice also mentioned how long it would be till we say goodbye to our dear friend: 3 to 5 years. Facial recognition is also one of the many upcoming??alternatives??coming to the tech world as early as September this year:<blockquote>"It also recognises your face and that you are you and it will display on your TV screen your menu. You can move your hand to move around and select what you want...??You even have emotive systems where you can wear a headset and control a computer by simply thinking and that's a device set to hit the market in September."????</blockquote>But many people (especially??the big guys in the computing mouse??business) have stated that this is a bogus report. Here is what??Rory Dooley, senior vice president and general manager of Logitech's control devices unit, had to say:<img src="http://i217.photobucket.com/albums/cc36/quebecftw/Picture5-1.png" height="144" width="254" />??<blockquote>"The death of the mouse is greatly exaggerated...??This just proves how important a device the mouse is.??People have been talking about convergence for years.??Today's TV works as a computer and today's computer works as a TV."????</blockquote>He did happen to mention that the market is becoming more and more open to other ways of interacting with computer, be it via a touch screen or by your voice.<img src="http://i217.photobucket.com/albums/cc36/quebecftw/_44491546_surface203300.jpg" height="300" width="203" />So be it. I, nor any blogger will be able to stop the demand for these types of technology... The most we can do is salvage our memories now. RIP the computer mouse.

How nice would it be to have an inexpensive computer that was solely designed for internet browsing.?? This is exactly what some people want.
<blockquote><em>Here's the basic idea: The machine is as thin as possible, runs low end hardware and has a single button for powering it on and off, headphone jacks, a built in camera for video, low end speakers, and a microphone. It will have Wifi, maybe one USB port, a built in battery, half a Gigabyte of RAM, a 4-Gigabyte solid state hard drive. Data input is primarily through an iPhone-like touch screen keyboard. It runs on linux and Firefox. It would be great to have it be built entirely on open source hardware, but including Skype for VOIP and video calls may be a nice touch, too.</em>

<em>If all you are doing is running Firefox and Skype, you don't need a lot of hardware horsepower, which will keep the cost way down.</em>

Link: <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/07/21/we-want-a-dead-simple-web-tablet-help-us-build-it/">We Want a Dead Simple Web Tablet...</a></blockquote>
The article is an interesting read, but I do not know if any of the big computer companies would take the time to develop such a simple piece of technology.?? They would have to sell a large number of these computers in order to make a profit.?? More importantly, ASUS already has something similar on the marketl the Eee PC.?? For under $500 dollars a user can get a small laptop that runs the bare necessities, but the monitor is rather small.

What do you think??? Would you be interested in a tablet-touch-screen, internet only laptop?

				<title>strat demo days at GC</title>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="float: left; padding: 10px;"><img src="http://static.lockergnome.com/avatars/author_1868? 1211904070" alt="Author Avatar" /></div>Since it's been a while and since I'm a glutton for punishment and since I don't often get to go into guitar stores with another lefty for pure entertainment, I managed to get by tonight.?? I heard all sorts of radio spots and even got a flyer for Guitar Center's Strat Demo Days.???? The apparent idea is to stop by and try out different Stratocasters (and amps) every week.

Personally I think you'd get better results by trying out different Strats through the same amp but what do <em>I</em> know.

I was greeted by a display demo of Strats.?? And some absolutely <em>horrid</em> noise.?? I looked around for the source of the industrial accident, half expecting to find an eighteen wheeler embedded in the wall and all sorts of construction equipment going full blast in hopes of rescuing said truck.

Nope, nothing that exciting.?? It was merely some fellow checking out a guitar and an amp.

GC has this policy of letting people play the guitars and amps, which tends to act as a deterrent to anybody <em>else</em> wanting to play the guitars and amps (or maintain what's left of their hearing and sanity).

Now let me set the mood further by telling you that my co-lefty this evening has a bit of a hearing impairment.?? She appeared to be in a quandary as to whether to turn off her hearing aids and be spared the aural assault or leave them on and still attempt to lip-read what others were saying.?? Choosing the latter, we proceeded to look around.

To no one's shock and surprise, the lefty selection was quite limited.?? They had a few more Epiphones, but I prefer guitars made from wood.

The real shock was that during Strat Demo Days, there were very few actual Strats on the walls.?? Those present were of two or three varieties.?? Nothing special or out of the ordinary.?? Considering that Fender will give a signature Strat to anyone who sneezes these days, it was odd not to find any.

Meanwhile, Mr. Malmsteen the Second continued to wail away.?? Or rather <em>wank</em> away. I was amazed that this denizen of digital dexterity did not choose an axe with a whammy bar so as to further convince everybody of his specialness.?? When I looked over, I realized he was holding a Gibson 335.?? The amp sounded so uniformly bad at all of its settings that you couldn't even make out that the fellow mangling the strings was using a 335.

The salesman, bless his heart, was attempting to sell an amp to this advanced wah wanker, but every point he was making had to be shouted over the din of the fellow trying out the amp.?? The salesman pointed out that this was a good choice because it was a very versatile amp, offering great tonal range.

I pointed out to my companion that even though it offered a lot of tones, it was of little value if all of them were bad (as was their input source).?? Plus if the salesman has to shout over your alleged playing, something is definitely wrong.

Unable to stand there any longer, we headed for Effects, where we encountered several other people who fled in hopes of aural salvation.?? They also had pained looks on their faces.?? I suspect the two behind the counter were deaf, as they showed no emotion or even notice of the audio devastation at all.?? These are probably the same people who never hear their own kids screaming at the mall or running up and down the aisles at a movie theater.?? After all, <em>their</em> Johnny would <em>never</em> do a thing like that.

I let loose the first phrase that came to mind (Volume is inversely proportional to talent), which was greeted with universal agreement. If nothing else, it was pretty damn accurate.

Unable to endure several of the recurring pains, we left the store.?? We traveled via the turnpike and were thankful for the relative relief of the jackhammers. <p>Related Articles: <div class="">			<ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="float: left; padding: 10px;"><img src="http://static.lockergnome.com/avatars/author_1868? 1211904070" alt="Author Avatar" /></div>This is a concept I've been working on ever since I got married.?? It is explained thusly:

If the president is no longer able to perform his presidential duties, the vice president steps in and takes over.

Therefore, if the wife is no longer able to perform her wifely duties, the vice wife steps in and takes over.?? Or assists as needed.

So far the reaction to this concept has varied from "Yeah, good luck with <em>that</em>" to "That is <em>not</em> funny."?? For some strange reason it tends to go over better with men than women uniformly.

My wife, a women of great humor (she married <em>me</em>, right?), fails to see either merit <em>or</em> humor in this.?? She asked me how I felt about a vice husband.?? I told her that if I fail to do my husbandly duties, she should get one.?? She was not impressed with that line of reasoning either.

It's not like I'm attempting to double my pleasure and double my fun with the wife <em>and</em> the vice wife; I'm not greedy.???? I'd just prefer that one or the other was active at all times.???? The country (and the marriage) needs its titular head at all times to function properly.

So folks, until I get some of the kinks out of the process, you'll probably want to avoid bringing up this topic with your other half.?? <em>Unless you're just itching for an argument, of course.</em> <p>Related Articles: <div class="">			<ul>

				<title>Consider Myself Alerted [Network Monitoring]</title>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="float: left; padding: 10px;"><img src="http://static.lockergnome.com/avatars/author_1868? 1211904070" alt="Author Avatar" /></div>I'm really keen on network monitoring.?? I have this thing about knowing how things are performing, if everything's up to spec, and if there are any impending problems that are going to cause way more grief than anyone needs.

If you can picture this, we have four twenty-two inch monitors, set up two by two, as a visual indicator of network status for the entire department.?? This never fails to impress everyone who sees it.?? I get the general impression that if the monitors fails to work, people would <em>still</em> be impressed by it.?? <em>Hint: drop a few bucks on four monitors and a mounting system.?? Put it up high or on the wall.?? Have it display something impressive.?? It's worth whatever it costs.?? It's like the machine that goes BING</em>.

There is a ton of software that will help you monitor your network.?? I like very little of it.?? I have tried everything from open-source to five-figure monitor software.?? At the moment, I'm finding the best, most comprehensive software is called The Dude.?? It's free.?? Yes, <em>free</em>.?? It runs under Windows or linux.?? It can monitor via plain old ping or do all sorts of snmp magic.?? It can notify you via all sorts of paths.

It is the alerting bit that I'm going to address. ?? I used to vpn into work fairly frequently to monitor things.?? As things were made more reliable, the need for watching lessened.?? As I stopped watching closely, things started to fail every now and then, just out of spite.?? After a brief huddle, I figured out how to make The Dude send a text message to my phone when something went down.?? The message states very plainly what stopped responding and when.?? Very useful.

The next day at work we had to do a lot of rebooting of a server for some installs.?? DING - "Server RINGO not responding to ping."?? DING - "Service ftp on RINGO down."?? DING = "Service http on RINGO down." ?? Yay - it worked!!!

Then there were the three DINGs telling me they had all come back up.?? "Yay," I thought, with somewhat less enthusiasm.?? This could potentially get slightly annoying.?? Especially as RINGO needed to be rebooted several times before the updates were complete.

It got to the point, over the next few days, when we'd all hear DING and I'd say, "It's ok, I'll get it."?? Ten times in a row.?? My coworkers were amused, especially as they didn't have to carry around my phone.?? I stopped the chuckling immediately when I told them that some of them were going to have to be on alert after I was nice enough to `tune' the alerting system first.?? I suspect some of the server reboots after that incident were not as needed as they claimed.

Last Wednesday I pulled up in front of my house and got a few DINGs.?? I rushed into the house with a phone that couldn't go DING fast enough to get the next DING out.?? I attempted to figure out what was allegedly down but every time I got a message up, a new DING preceeded a new message.

I tried phoning people still at work.?? Nope - the DINGing continued.?? I could barely get a number dialed or hear a voicemail prompt. ?? Have you ever noticed that outgoing voicemail messages are even <em>longer</em> when you're agitated and really <em>need</em> to get in touch with someone??? I did.?? As did my wife and houseguest, who had to suffer through the constant DINGing as well as my constant cursing about the phone `helping' me by constantly interrupting whatever I was trying to do on it to tell me there was a text message waiting for me.?? And then cursing because out of three people on staff at that hour, I got three voicemails.

By the time the phone stopped DINGing long enough for me to feel it was safe, the total was<em> ONE HUNDRED NINETY TWO messages</em>.?? Only one hundred ninety two DINGs.

I finally reached someone who told me everything was fine.?? It appeared that someone may have `helped' us out by unplugging a switch or two, causing <em>all</em> connectivity to appear down.?? Or someone on the floor made one of those nice little loops, where they plug a hub or switch into itself, causing Network Havoc&lt;tm&gt;.

I figured it was my fault anyway.?? For some odd reason I have been waking up at horrible hours of the morning and going to work early as a result.?? The first time I figured I'd leave an hour early and forgot I was supposed to (always something to do anyway).?? The next day, the Wednesday in question, I left an hour early because I came in over an hour early and I had company.?? So if I had put in a 9-10 hour day, I would have been there when everything went wonky.?? Mind you there's quite a competent crew there so I don 't technically have to feel that bad when I'm not in the office but it's my parents' fault for giving me this nasty work ethic.

At this point I start investigating dependencies; where if a switch or firewall was down, it would alert me but if anything under it was down, they wouldn't.?? This is a great concept but it fails a bit in the execution.?? I need to know when any single piece goes down and comes back up.

Until an epiphany sets in, I'm going to have to endure a lot of DINGing.?? I figure I'll get a lot more help on this project once I start adding coworkers to the DING list.?? In the midst of virtualization, I'm hoping that less hardware will mean less alerts. <p>Related Articles: <div class="">			<ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="float: left; padding: 10px;"><img src="http://static.lockergnome.com/avatars/author_1653? 1212118761" alt="Author Avatar" /></div>I recently got Dragon Ball Z: Burst Limit for my PS3 because I am a big fan of the DBZ anime series and since I haven't played a DBZ fighting game since the first ones that were released for the PS2 and Gamecube. Since I thought this game would be good I decided to pick it up and give it a try. Now this game has a Story Mode, VS. Mode, Online VS. Mode, and Training. If this would be you first DBZ fighting game then you should do the training to get use to the game, even people that have played old DBZ games before should go through the training so they can go over the buttons and try out everything before getting to the Story Mode or playing against someone, you also get something from doing the Training Mode.Now this game for the Xbox 360 and PS3 game is kinda short it doesn't complete the whole DBZ saga but it's still a great game for a what it offers in the story mode because they add some characters from two movies and add those scenes to the Story Mode.

You don't get a lot of characters to play with especially coming from the other DBZ games but that was fine since the game still played out fine. Now one of the only problems I had is that when playing through the Story Mode the computer player always blocked a lot and that kinda got annoying, and after a while of fighting them you get used to what there going to do. Now online mode is great you can invite your friends to play and even play with other people around the world. Now one of the only problems that I had from the online play is that a lot of people were lagging when playing online, maybe it's because sometimes I was playing against people from other countries but the game does tell you how good the connection of your opponent is so you can decide if you want to play or not. This is a great DBZ game, fans of the anime series won't be disappointed and it's also a great fighting game that you can play with friends offline or online and something for a Fighting game fans to play until Soul Calibur 4 comes out. <p>Related Articles: <div class="">			<ul>

The rate was decent at 10%. I then missed 1 payment and the APR skyrocketed to 28%. OK, so I call QuickenCard, which is CitiBank. I ask them to please lower my APR. They say OK, and that it will be done in 1 month. Enter Chase, who takes over the QuickenCard services. I notice on my first statement with the new bank that my APR is 28%. I call and ask about getting a lower rate. Nope, can't do it. "We don't have access to your previous information." I spoke to a supervisor, same thing.

I have fairly decent credit, and even another Chase card with an 11% rate. Why the 28% rate? Because they can, and there's nothing I can do about it. Too bad that Chase is giving Quicken a bad name, I will never buy another Quicken product. I would suggest you do the same. Microsoft and HR Block make better money products anyways. <p>Related Articles: <div class="">			<ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="float: left; padding: 10px;"><img src="http://static.lockergnome.com/avatars/author_1394? 1211852643" alt="Author Avatar" /></div>Cords, cords cords.?? In today's world, electronic devices almost define us.?? Along with them goes corded chargers.?? Since companies love to sell you accessories, they are all proprietary, meaning you have to have one for each of your devices.?? I have a box full of wall chargers and I haven't got a clue what they go to, just sitting in my closet.?? Most from old devices that are stored somewhere in this apartment, I have no clue where.

Named one of TIME magazine???s best inventions of the year, the <a href="http://www.wildcharge.com/" rel="nofollow">WildCharger</a> is a flat, thin pad (it could easily be mistaken for a mouse pad) with a conductive surface. When the pad is plugged in, any cell phone or other electronic device that is set on it automatically begins to charge. Well, OK, it???s not quite that easy: the cell phone or device must first be equipped with a WildCharge adapter in order to power up. An adapter connects to a device???s battery cover and has tiny bumps all over it that, when in contact with any part of the pad, receive power and transfer it inward. The pad can be used universally with any device that has an adapter ??? meaning all different types and brands of cell phones or music and video players can be charged on any pad. And, the charging speed is exactly the same as if the device was plugged into an outlet with a charger.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teddgcm/2690487777/" title="image-1 by teddgcm, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3204/2690487777_cea1b45434_o.jpg" alt="image-1" width="454" height="182" /></a>

Right now the device is limited to certain brands, such as the Motorola RAZR and iPod.?? Each device has to be equipped with an adapter that allows the charge to reach the battery, but can't you see this being updated so all you have to do is lay any electronic device on it to charge??? It will sense anything that is not meant to be on it, such as car keys, and shut itself down, then restart once those items are removed and a compatible device is set on it.

I can see coffee tables embedded with this and other surfaces you might routinely put your electronic devices. <p>Related Articles: <div class="">			<ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="float: left; padding: 10px;"><img src="http://static.lockergnome.com/avatars/gnomedaily.gif? " alt="Author Avatar" /></div>Why do we watch movies? Are they merely easier to digest than books? They are definitely faster to consume. Is it just the bright shinies of the silver screen that attract us, the explosions, guts, and sex???I subscribe to a different school of thought. Unfortunately, there are very few reminders these days as to why we prefer movies to books, besides the obvious ease with which we enjoy them. Occasionally, an actor undertakes such a mind blowing performance that we are reminded why we fork out ten bucks for a ticket and an extra ten for some burnt popcorn and a watery beverage.

<p>To be blunt, Heath Ledger's Joker could very well be the greatest character portrayal of all time. I'm not talking the top ten here; I'm talking number one. Ledger's performance is absolutely flawless, and it is obvious that he completely loses himself in his character. He makes the other actors' performances seem almost remedial, especially Bales. The performance is easily Ledger's best and is easily deserving of best actor.

<p>That being said, lets discuss the movie. The Dark Knight on its own merit is ok. It's not mind blowing. There is a single performance that makes the movie "good." To put this in another perspective, would putting Ken Griffey, Jr. on a little league team make the team "good?" I'd bet not. This same premise applies to The Dark Knight; it's a fun movie, but not quite up to par. It is obvious that the writers were trying to tie in as much of the old-school Batman as possible (bat computer, Two Face, etc.), and this makes bits of the movie seem almost forced (quite a bit of cell phone product placement is also an unwelcome touch).

<p>How could I be so harsh? The simple fact is, there is enough of the Joker in the movie to make it fantastically entertaining. This movie is by far a must see, if not for anything else, for Ledger's performance alone. It's a fitting end to a fantastic career. <p>Related Articles: <div class="">			<ul>

				<title>Circulate Prologue Review</title>

				<guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.lockergnome.com/igames/2008/07/21/circulate-prologue-review/</guid>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="float: left; padding: 10px;"><img src="http://static.lockergnome.com/avatars/author_1001? 1216590631" alt="Author Avatar" /></div><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3002/2691131456_f493e6040f.jpg?v=0" align="middle" height="197" width="276" />

Circulate Prologue was released today on in the App Store for the modest price of $.99 and is another addition to the huge collection of puzzle games for the iPhone. You may have already heard of the game Circulate before because it has been released in the past for numerous cell phones. As you may of noticed the game features the word prologue to its name because this inst the full game.

<img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3295/2690322079_8cf1b3ebee.jpg?v=0" height="197" width="296" />

This shouldn't scare you away from buying it though because the few hours I have put into have been pretty fun. The gameplay starts off simple and gets pretty complex.?? You have to get three of the same color spheres touching for a few seconds for them to disappear and for you to get points and to extend the time. This is basically the first few levels. After a while bombs and Grey color spheres will start to drop and you have to tap the bomb to blow up the Grey spheres and some of the other surrounding spheres. You have to tilt the screen around, surprise, to move the spheres around and try to match them up.

<img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3133/2691135082_7a0ecf9a2b.jpg?v=0" height="197" width="296" />

I really like the graphics in this game. Everything is bright and the levels change without a loading screen at all and the action keeps going as the level changes. The strong point of this game is its sound. The music in the game is MP3 quality and really gives a good relaxing score, almost rivaling that of Aqua Forrest.

If you have a dollar to spend this game is worth checking out. I suspect that the full game will be released here shortly and that should be fun to play also, until then enjoy this game.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="float: left; padding: 10px;"><img src="http://static.lockergnome.com/avatars/gnomedaily.gif? " alt="Author Avatar" /></div>Sometimes we dentists feel like we're in charge of the confessional "Dr I haven't flossed for a year, Dr I know I clench my teeth, Dr I know I should have gotten that crown"?? "Ok Mrs O'malley give me three flossings, one fluoride treatment, a cleaning and you are forgiven" ???? I get it all the time, and I'm here to say lose it.?? Forget it, and stop feeling guilty about the choices you make with your oral health.?? I have had multiple patients of late, good patients that took fantastic care of their teeth, all of the sudden have problems.?? In both cases these people had lost loved ones, in one case multiple loved ones, and friends.?? What am I supposed to say, "Ken you've lost your wife, and are grieving, but damnit you should be flossing better, and now there are 3 cavities because you haven't brushed for a month"???? I can't do that, it's cruel,?? I treat my patients like family so I just can't do it.???? I don't care how bad it gets, I want my patients to trust that I will help them get better, and work to prevent things from getting worse.???? In both cases I was able to provide some preventive measures to help the patients get through their grieving, and we mopped things up when they were ready. ?? It doesn't mean I won't still provide preventive advice, or my opinion as to which treatment would be best, but we as dentists do understand our patients make decisions based on the greater context of their own lives, and it's ok, so lose the guilt, go in, get it fixed. <p>Related Articles: <div class="">			<ul>

				<title>Help Build A Simple Web Tablet For $200</title>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="float: left; padding: 10px;"><img src="http://static.lockergnome.com/avatars/author_45? 1179783897" alt="Author Avatar" /></div>OK you techies. Here is your chance to get in on the bottom floor on a project over at TechCrunch. They want to design a web tablet and want to keep the price at $200. They are looking for techies to join in on the project and to actually develop a prototype of the unit. They list some of what they want the unit to be as:
<blockquote><strong>I???m tired of waiting - I want a dead simple and dirt cheap touch screen web tablet to surf the web. Nothing fancy like the Dell Latitude XT , which costs $2,500. Just a Macbook Air-thin touch screen machine that runs Firefox and possibly Skype on top of a Linux kernel. It doesn???t exist today, and as far as we can tell no one is creating one. So let???s design it, build a few and then open source the specs so anyone can create them. </strong>

<strong>Here???s the basic idea: The machine is as thin as possible, runs low end hardware and has a single button for powering it on and off, headphone jacks, a built in camera for video, low end speakers, and a microphone. It will have Wifi, maybe one USB port, a built in battery, half a Gigabyte of RAM, a 4-Gigabyte solid state hard drive. Data input is primarily through an iPhone-like touch screen keyboard. It runs on linux and Firefox. It would be great to have it be built entirely on open source hardware, but including Skype for VOIP and video calls may be a nice touch, too. </strong>

<strong>If all you are doing is running Firefox and Skype, you don???t need a lot of hardware horsepower, which will keep the cost way down.</strong>

<strong>The idea is to turn it on, bypass any desktop interface, and go directly to Firefox running in a modified Kiosk Mode that effectively turns the browser into the operating system for the device. Add Gears for offline syncing of Google docs, email, etc., and Skype for communication and you have a machine that will be almost as useful as a desktop but cheaper and more portable than any laptop or tablet PC. </strong>

<strong>It will also include a custom default home page with large buttons for bookmarked services - news, Meebo/Ebuddy for IM, Google Docs/Zoho for Office, Email, social networks, photo sites, YouTube, etc. Everything that you use every day.</strong>

<strong>We???re working with a supply chain management company that says the basic machine we???re looking to build can be created for just a few hundred dollars. They need us to write the software modifications to Linux and Firefox (more on that below) and spec the hardware. Then they run with it and can have a few prototypes built within a month.</strong>

<strong>What will we call it? The best name I can think of is the Firefox Tablet, but that will take a round of discussions with Mozilla.</strong></blockquote>
I'll tell you one thing. I give the folks over at TechCrunch credit for taking on a project that would provide a useful and simple device for surfing the Internet. That they are asking for assistance from the public is also commendable. So if you have something to offer, join in and help to develop this new device. Even if you have no techie abilities, join in a give the project your support. Already over 200 folks have already left comments.

Here is how to join in:
<blockquote><strong>We???ll be coordinating the project <a href="http://www.techcrunchit.com/2008/07/21/the-techcrunch-web-tablet-project/">over at TechCrunchIT<img src="http://i.ixnp.com/images/v3.39.1/t.gif" /></a>. Leave a comment there if you want to participate and we???ll be in touch soon.</strong></blockquote>
Comments welcome.

Spread the word.

Over the years, I developed pulpuslaceratapohobia  - and the only known cure for that is &lt;a href=&quot;http://audiblepodcast.com/chris&quot;&gt;Audible&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, a way to digest words without actually having to read them. Professional voices are wonderful choices if you love literary works in audio format.

  It doesn't matter if you're running on Windows or Mac OS X - every power user needs either &lt;a href=&quot;http://send.onenetworkdirect.net/z/13766/rn_a32755/&quot;&gt;Parallels&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://send.onenetworkdirect.net/z/17081/rn_a32755/&quot;&gt;VMware&lt;/a&gt; (or both). There's never been an easier way to test software without destroying your primary operating system's stability. Think of how many times you wish you could press a 'reverse' button on your computer. Plus, there's no easier way to try new Linux distributions - see what all the fuss is about. Run Windows in OS X, run Linux in Windows, but the best way to do either is with &lt;a href=&quot;http://send.onenetworkdirect.net/z/17081/rn_a32755/&quot;&gt;VMware&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=&quot;http://send.onenetworkdirect.net/z/13766/rn_a32755/&quot;&gt;Parallels&lt;/a&gt;.

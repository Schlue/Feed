<h2>How to use RSS</h2>

<p class="text">

To access these feeds in a readable format, you need an RSS reader/aggregator. There are three main ways to use an RSS aggregator: a client-based application, a plug-in for your browser, or a web script that runs on your website.
<p class="text">
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://blogspace.com/rss/readers">Blogspace</a> has a good list of Windows/Linux/Mac clients, many of them freeware.</li>
<li>There are <a href="https://addons.update.mozilla.org/extensions/showlist.php?application=firefox&version=1.0&os=all&category=News%20Reading" target="_blank">RSS extensions</a> for the excellent (and secure) <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/" target="_blank">Firefox</a> &amp; Mozilla Web browsers; there are also <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=rss+internet+explorer&sourceid=mozilla-search&start=0&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8" target="_blank">several</a> RSS toolbars/sidebars available for Internet Explorer.</li>
</ul>
